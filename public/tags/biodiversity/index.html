    <h1 id="biological-invasion">Biological Invasion</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-biological-invasion">What is Biological Invasion?</h2>
<p>Biological invasion occurs when non-native species, also known as invasive species, are introduced to a new habitat. In these new environments, they establish themselves, spread, and often cause harm to the local ecosystem, economy, or even human health. These invasions can happen due to various human activities, such as trade, travel, and agriculture. For example, when ships transport goods from one country to another, they might unintentionally carry small plants or animals that can thrive in the new location, disrupting the local environment.</p>

    <h1 id="concept-of-ecology">Concept of Ecology</h1>
<p>Ecology is the scientific study of the interactions between living organisms and their environment. It encompasses the relationships among organisms, their physical surroundings, and the processes that govern the distribution and abundance of life on Earth. The concept of ecology is essential for understanding the complex web of life and the impacts of human activities on natural systems.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Interdependence</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organisms are interconnected and rely on one another for survival. This principle emphasizes that changes in one species can affect others, highlighting the importance of biodiversity. For example, the decline of a keystone species, such as the sea otter, can lead to overpopulation of sea urchins, which in turn devastates kelp forests. This interconnectedness underlines the importance of maintaining healthy ecosystems.</li>

    <h1 id="concept-of-ecosystem">Concept of Ecosystem</h1>
<p>An ecosystem is a complex network of living organisms (biotic factors) and their physical environment (abiotic factors) interacting as a system. Ecosystems can vary in size and can be found in various environments, from a small pond to a vast forest or a desert. The interactions among the components of an ecosystem are crucial for maintaining the balance of nature.</p>

    <h1 id="darwinism--concept-of-neo-darwinism">Darwinism &amp; Concept of Neo-Darwinism</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Darwinism</strong> refers to the theories of biological evolution developed by <strong>Charles Darwin</strong>, particularly his concept of natural selection. This theory explains how species evolve over time through the differential survival and reproduction of individuals with advantageous traits. Darwin introduced these ideas in his famous book, <strong>&ldquo;On the Origin of Species,&rdquo;</strong> published in 1859. <strong>Neo-Darwinism</strong>, also known as the modern synthesis, incorporates genetics into Darwinâ€™s original ideas, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how evolution occurs. It blends Darwin&rsquo;s principles with discoveries in genetics, emphasizing that evolution is driven by genetic variations in populations.</p>

    <h1 id="differences-between-apes--man">Differences between Apes &amp; Man</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Apes and humans share a common ancestor and belong to the primate family, but they exhibit distinct differences in various aspects. Understanding these differences helps highlight the unique evolutionary path that humans have taken, leading to advanced cognitive abilities, social structures, and physical adaptations. While both groups show remarkable intelligence and social behaviors, the differences underscore the evolutionary divergence that has occurred over millions of years.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/neb/bio11/zoology/evolutionary-biology/evidences-of-evolution/">Evidences of Evolution</a></h2>
    <h1 id="evidences-of-evolution">Evidences of Evolution</h1>
<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The theory of evolution explains how species change over time through processes like natural selection and adaptation. Various types of evidence support this theory, helping us understand how life has diversified on Earth. These evidences include <strong>morphological</strong>, <strong>anatomical</strong>, <strong>paleontological</strong>, <strong>embryological</strong>, and <strong>biochemical</strong> evidence.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-morphological-evidence">1. Morphological Evidence</h2>
<p>Morphological evidence refers to the study of the form and structure of organisms. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Homologous Structures</strong>: Similar in structure but serve different functions in different species.</p>

<h2 id="key-evolutionary-stages">Key Evolutionary Stages</h2>
<h3 id="1-anthropoid-ancestors">1. Anthropoid Ancestors</h3>
<p>The first major step in human evolution began around 60 million years ago with small primates known as anthropoids. These primates lived in trees and had special traits like forward-facing eyes, which helped them judge distances and grab onto branches. Their grasping hands and flexible limbs were perfect for swinging and climbing through trees. These early primates were important because they gave rise to both monkeys and apes, including our direct ancestors.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/neb/bio11/zoology/evolutionary-biology/theories-of-evolution/lamarckism/">Lamarckism</a></h2>
    <h1 id="lamarckism">Lamarckism</h1>
<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Lamarckism is an early theory of evolution proposed by the French naturalist <strong>Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</strong> in the early 19th century. This theory emphasizes the idea that organisms can acquire traits during their lifetime and pass these traits to their offspring. Although Lamarckism has been largely discredited in favor of Charles Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection, it played a crucial role in the development of evolutionary thought and understanding.</p>

      <p>Lamarck argued, as part of his theory of heredity, that a blacksmith&rsquo;s sons inherit the strong muscles he acquires from his work.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/neb/bio11/zoology/evolutionary-biology/human-evolution/position-of-man/">Position of Man in Animal Kingdom</a></h2>
    <h1 id="position-of-man-in-animal-kingdom">Position of Man in Animal Kingdom</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Humans, scientifically known as <strong>Homo sapiens</strong>, hold a unique position in the animal kingdom. This position is defined by their classification within the broader hierarchy of life, emphasizing their evolutionary history, anatomical features, and behavioral characteristics.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="taxonomic-classification-of-humans">Taxonomic Classification of Humans</h2>
<p>Humans belong to the following taxonomic categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain</strong>: Eukarya<br>
Organisms with complex cells containing a nucleus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kingdom</strong>: Animalia<br>
Multicellular, heterotrophic organisms that do not have cell walls.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/neb/bio11/botany/ecology/ecological-adaptation/concept-of-adaptation/">Concept of Adaptation</a></h2>
    <h1 id="concept-of-adaptation">Concept of Adaptation</h1>
<p>Adaptation is a fundamental concept in biology that refers to the process by which organisms evolve to become better suited to their environment. This process enhances their chances of survival and reproduction, enabling them to thrive in changing conditions. Adaptations can occur at the individual level within a lifetime (phenotypic plasticity) or across generations (evolutionary adaptation).</p>

    alt="Lamarck&#39;s Two-Factor Theory"><figcaption>
      <p>The second of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck&rsquo;s two factors (the first being a complexifying force) was an adaptive force that causes animals with a given body plan to adapt to circumstances by inheritance of acquired characteristics, creating a diversity of species and genera.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/neb/bio11/botany/floral-diversity/introduction/three-domains-of-life/">Three Domains of Life</a></h2>
    <h1 id="three-domains-of-life">Three Domains of Life</h1>
<p>The classification of life on Earth is organized into three primary domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. This classification is based on genetic and biochemical differences, providing insights into the diversity of life forms. Understanding these domains helps us appreciate the evolutionary relationships between different organisms and the environments they inhabit.</p>

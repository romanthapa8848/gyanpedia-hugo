      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;bacteriophage&#34;&gt;Bacteriophage&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bacteriophages, commonly known as phages, are viruses that specifically infect and replicate within bacteria. They are among the most abundant biological entities on Earth, outnumbering bacteria by a factor of 10 to 1. Phages play significant roles in various ecosystems by influencing bacterial populations and promoting genetic diversity among bacteria. Bacteriophages have a complex structure, consisting of a protein coat that encases their genetic material, which can be either DNA or RNA. Their specificity and ability to replicate within bacterial cells make them a fascinating subject of study in microbiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

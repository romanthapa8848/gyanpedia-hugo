    <h1 id="acid-rain">Acid Rain</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-acid-rain">What is Acid Rain?</h2>
<p>Acid rain refers to any form of precipitation—such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail—that has a lower pH than normal rainwater, making it more acidic. While normal rain has a pH of about 5.6, acid rain can have a pH as low as 4.0 or even lower. This increased acidity occurs when sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$) and nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}_x$) are released into the atmosphere. These pollutants react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the air to form sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$) and nitric acid ($\text{HNO}_3$). When this acidic precipitation falls to the ground, it can have harmful effects on the environment, human health, and infrastructure.</p>

    <h1 id="depletion-of-ozone-layer">Depletion of Ozone Layer</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-the-ozone-layer">What is the Ozone Layer?</h2>
<p>The ozone layer is a region of Earth&rsquo;s stratosphere that contains a high concentration of ozone ($\text{O}_3$) molecules. It is located about 10 to 30 miles above the Earth&rsquo;s surface. The ozone layer plays a crucial role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing most of the Sun&rsquo;s harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Without this protective layer, increased levels of UV radiation would reach the surface, posing serious risks to human health, animals, and ecosystems.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="greenhouse-effect">Greenhouse Effect</h2>
<p>The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth&rsquo;s surface, making it livable. When sunlight reaches the Earth, some of it is reflected back into space, while the rest is absorbed by the land and oceans, warming the planet. This heat is then radiated back towards space, but certain gases in the atmosphere trap some of this heat, creating a “blanket” around the Earth. This process helps keep our planet warm enough to support life, allowing plants and animals to thrive.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-vegetation">What is Vegetation?</h2>
<p>Vegetation refers to the plant life found in a particular area or region. It encompasses a wide variety of plant types, including trees, shrubs, grasses, and herbs. Vegetation is a vital part of our planet, playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. The types of vegetation found in an area are influenced by several factors, including climate, soil type, topography, and human activities. Understanding vegetation helps us appreciate the rich biodiversity around us and its importance in sustaining life.</p>

    <h1 id="concept-of-ecology">Concept of Ecology</h1>
<p>Ecology is the scientific study of the interactions between living organisms and their environment. It encompasses the relationships among organisms, their physical surroundings, and the processes that govern the distribution and abundance of life on Earth. The concept of ecology is essential for understanding the complex web of life and the impacts of human activities on natural systems.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Interdependence</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organisms are interconnected and rely on one another for survival. This principle emphasizes that changes in one species can affect others, highlighting the importance of biodiversity. For example, the decline of a keystone species, such as the sea otter, can lead to overpopulation of sea urchins, which in turn devastates kelp forests. This interconnectedness underlines the importance of maintaining healthy ecosystems.</li>

    <h1 id="concept-of-ecosystem">Concept of Ecosystem</h1>
<p>An ecosystem is a complex network of living organisms (biotic factors) and their physical environment (abiotic factors) interacting as a system. Ecosystems can vary in size and can be found in various environments, from a small pond to a vast forest or a desert. The interactions among the components of an ecosystem are crucial for maintaining the balance of nature.</p>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cyanobacteria-the-blue-green-algae&#34;&gt;Cyanobacteria: The Blue-Green Algae&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cyanobacteria, commonly known as blue-green algae, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria that play a critical role in many aquatic ecosystems. Unlike true algae, which are eukaryotic organisms, cyanobacteria are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They are unique due to their ability to perform photosynthesis using chlorophyll a, which enables them to convert light energy into chemical energy and produce oxygen as a byproduct. Cyanobacteria are found in a variety of habitats, including freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments, and they often form blooms in nutrient-rich waters, particularly during warm seasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

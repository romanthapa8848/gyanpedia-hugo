Anthropoid Ancestors&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first major step in human evolution began around 60 million years ago with small primates known as anthropoids. These primates lived in trees and had special traits like forward-facing eyes, which helped them judge distances and grab onto branches. Their grasping hands and flexible limbs were perfect for swinging and climbing through trees. These early primates were important because they gave rise to both monkeys and apes, including our direct ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

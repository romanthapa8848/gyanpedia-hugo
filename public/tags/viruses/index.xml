      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;virus-general-introduction-structure-and-importance-of-virus&#34;&gt;Virus: General Introduction, Structure and Importance of Virus&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Viruses are microscopic infectious agents that can only replicate inside the living cells of an organism. Unlike bacteria or fungi, viruses are not classified as living organisms due to their inability to carry out metabolic processes on their own. They lack the cellular machinery necessary for reproduction and rely entirely on the host cell&amp;rsquo;s machinery to replicate. Viruses are composed of genetic material (either DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat known as the capsid and, in some cases, an outer lipid envelope. Viruses infect all types of life forms, including animals, plants, and even bacteria (the latter are known as bacteriophages).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

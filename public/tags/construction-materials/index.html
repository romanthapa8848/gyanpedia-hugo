<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Cement is a crucial construction material with various types, each serving specific purposes based on its properties. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC), and specialized types like sulfate-resistant and rapid hardening cement are commonly used in construction. Understanding these types and their properties ensures optimal performance in diverse applications, contributing to the strength and durability of structures.</p>

<h2 id="1-types-of-lime">1. Types of Lime</h2>
<p>Lime can be classified into several categories based on its production process and chemical composition:</p>
<h3 id="a-quicklime-calcium-oxide">a. Quicklime (Calcium Oxide)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Quicklime is produced by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) in a kiln to high temperatures (around 900°C to 1,000°C), resulting in a white, powdery substance.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Formula:</strong> $CaO$</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Highly reactive; generates heat when mixed with water, leading to a significant increase in temperature.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-hydrated-lime-calcium-hydroxide">b. Hydrated Lime (Calcium Hydroxide)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Hydrated lime is created by adding water to quicklime. This process results in a fine powder that is less reactive than quicklime.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Formula:</strong> $Ca(OH)_2$</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> It is safe to handle and is commonly used in various applications, including soil stabilization and as a binding agent in mortars.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-agricultural-lime-calcium-carbonate">c. Agricultural Lime (Calcium Carbonate)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> This form of lime is essentially ground limestone, used primarily to improve soil quality and pH balance in agricultural applications.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Formula:</strong> $CaCO_3$</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Less reactive compared to quicklime and hydrated lime, making it suitable for use in soil amendment.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-objectives">Project Objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Project objectives</strong> are the specific, measurable, and time-bound outcomes that a project aims to achieve. Objectives provide clear direction and a measurable way to assess project success. These are typically broken down into smaller, actionable tasks and are aligned with the broader goals of the organization.</p>

<li><strong>Achievable</strong>: Realistic within the scope of available resources.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant</strong>: Align with broader organizational goals.</li>

<h2 id="relationship-between-objectives-and-goals">Relationship Between Objectives and Goals</h2>
<p>While <strong>goals</strong> are the overarching intentions of a project, <strong>objectives</strong> are the actionable steps that help achieve these goals. Objectives break down the larger goals into measurable tasks, and they are crucial for assessing progress. Without clear objectives, it would be challenging to track whether the goals are being met.</p>
<hr>

<li><strong>Clear Direction</strong>: They provide a roadmap, ensuring all team members are aligned and working towards a common purpose.</li>

<li><strong>Resource Allocation</strong>: Help prioritize resources effectively by focusing efforts on the most important outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: Clear goals and objectives help identify potential risks and challenges early on.</li>
</ol>

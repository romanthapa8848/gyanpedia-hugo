<p>Glass is a versatile and widely used material in modern construction and architecture. It is valued for its transparency, durability, and aesthetic qualities. Various types of glass are used in buildings for windows, doors, facades, and decorative elements, each having unique properties and applications.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-what-is-glass">1. What is Glass?</h2>
<p>Glass is an inorganic, non-crystalline, transparent or translucent material, typically composed of silica (sand), soda, and lime. It is produced by heating these materials to high temperatures and then cooling them to form a solid. Glass can be formed into a wide range of shapes and sizes, making it ideal for architectural applications.</p>

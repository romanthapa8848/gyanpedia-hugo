<p>Tiles are versatile building materials used in both residential and commercial spaces for flooring, walls, and other surfaces. Their aesthetic appeal, durability, and ease of maintenance make them popular choices in construction and interior design. This document outlines the various types of tiles and their characteristics.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-types-of-tiles">1. Types of Tiles</h2>
<p>Tiles can be classified based on several factors, including material, size, application, and finish. Here are the most common types:</p>
<h3 id="a-ceramic-tiles">a. Ceramic Tiles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Made from clay and other natural materials, ceramic tiles are fired at high temperatures to create a hard, durable surface. They are available in various colors and patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Types:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glazed Ceramic Tiles:</strong> Have a glass-like coating that makes them water-resistant and easy to clean. Ideal for moisture-prone areas.</li>
<li><strong>Unglazed Ceramic Tiles:</strong> More porous and suitable for areas with high foot traffic, offering better slip resistance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> Commonly used for flooring, walls, and backsplashes in both residential and commercial settings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-porcelain-tiles">b. Porcelain Tiles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> A subtype of ceramic tiles, porcelain tiles are denser and less porous, making them more durable and suitable for high-moisture areas. They often replicate the appearance of natural stone or wood.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Resistant to stains, scratches, and moisture, making them an excellent choice for high-traffic areas.</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> Ideal for bathrooms, kitchens, and outdoor spaces where durability is crucial.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-natural-stone-tiles">c. Natural Stone Tiles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Sourced from natural stone materials such as granite, marble, limestone, and slate, these tiles offer a unique and elegant look, with each tile having distinct natural variations.</li>
<li><strong>Types:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Granite Tiles:</strong> Known for their hardness and resistance to scratches and heat.</li>
<li><strong>Marble Tiles:</strong> Renowned for their beauty and variety, though they require more maintenance due to their porous nature.</li>
<li><strong>Slate Tiles:</strong> Durable and slip-resistant, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="e-vinyl-tiles">e. Vinyl Tiles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Made from synthetic materials, vinyl tiles are cost-effective and easy to install. They come in various styles and can mimic other materials like wood and stone.</li>
<li><strong>Types:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Luxury Vinyl Tiles (LVT):</strong> Offer a more realistic look and feel, making them ideal for residential and commercial settings.</li>
<li><strong>Vinyl Composite Tiles (VCT):</strong> Durable and suitable for high-traffic areas, commonly used in commercial spaces such as schools and hospitals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> Suitable for both residential and commercial flooring due to their durability and versatility.</li>

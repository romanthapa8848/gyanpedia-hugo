         <h1 id="tendering-procedure">Tendering Procedure</h1>
<p>The tendering procedure is a formal process used to invite bids from contractors and suppliers for projects. It is an essential aspect of procurement management, ensuring that the right contractor is selected to execute the work, within budget, and on time. The tendering procedure varies based on the nature of the project, the client’s needs, and the legal framework governing procurement.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="stages-of-tendering-procedure">Stages of Tendering Procedure</h2>
<h3 id="1-pre-tender-stage">1. Pre-Tender Stage</h3>
<p>Before the actual tendering process begins, the following steps are generally carried out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Scope Definition</strong>: Clear project requirements are established, including detailed specifications and drawings.</li>
<li><strong>Preparation of Tender Documents</strong>: The client prepares documents such as the invitation to tender, specifications, bill of quantities, and terms of the contract.</li>
<li><strong>Inviting Tenders</strong>: The client invites potential contractors to submit bids for the project, often using advertisements, direct invitations, or prequalification processes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-tender-submission">2. Tender Submission</h3>
<p>Once the tender documents are ready, contractors are invited to submit their bids. Contractors are expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submit Tender</strong>: Contractors submit their bids based on the specifications and requirements outlined in the tender documents.</li>
<li><strong>Review and Clarification</strong>: Contractors may ask for clarifications on tender documents to ensure accurate bids.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-tender-opening">3. Tender Opening</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opening of Bids</strong>: After the submission deadline, all tenders are opened in the presence of a committee, ensuring transparency in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Evaluation</strong>: The submitted tenders are evaluated based on compliance with the requirements, bid completeness, and accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-tender-evaluation">4. Tender Evaluation</h3>
<p>In this stage, the tenders are evaluated on various criteria such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compliance Check</strong>: Ensuring that the bids meet all technical, financial, and legal requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Comparison</strong>: Evaluating the financial aspects, including the overall cost and payment terms.</li>
<li><strong>Qualification Assessment</strong>: Assessing the contractor’s ability to execute the project, including their experience, capacity, and resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-tender-awarding">5. Tender Awarding</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision Making</strong>: The best-suited contractor is selected based on evaluation results. The decision can be based on the lowest bid, best value for money, or other criteria such as technical expertise and project history.</li>
<li><strong>Contract Negotiation</strong>: Once the winning tender is identified, a contract is negotiated and finalized. This may involve further clarifications, adjustments to terms, or the inclusion of additional conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-post-tender-activities">6. Post-Tender Activities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contract Signing</strong>: The client and the contractor sign a formal contract, officially starting the project.</li>
<li><strong>Commencement of Work</strong>: Work on the project begins as per the terms agreed in the contract.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="types-of-tenders">Types of Tenders</h2>
<h3 id="1-open-tendering">1. Open Tendering</h3>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-selective-tendering">2. Selective Tendering</h3>
<ul>

<li><strong>Advantages</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Ensures that only qualified contractors bid.</li>
<li>Saves time by limiting the number of tenders to review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>:

<li><strong>Advantages</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Greater flexibility in terms and conditions.</li>
<li>Faster than open or selective tendering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>:

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-two-stage-tendering">4. Two-Stage Tendering</h3>

<li>Ensures that contractors are involved in the planning process.</li>
</ul>
</li>

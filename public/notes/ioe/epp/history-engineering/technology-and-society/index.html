<p>The relationship between technology and society is one of profound interconnection. As technology advances, it has a profound impact on the structures, values, and functioning of society. On the other hand, societal needs and values often influence the direction and purpose of technological innovations. This reciprocal relationship has led to remarkable progress, but also presented challenges and ethical dilemmas that must be addressed.</p>
<p>Technology has been a central force in shaping modern society, transforming the way we communicate, work, and interact. However, it has also created new social, ethical, and environmental issues that society must navigate.</p>

<h2 id="1-historical-overview-of-technologys-impact-on-society">1. <strong>Historical Overview of Technology&rsquo;s Impact on Society</strong></h2>
<p>From the earliest use of fire to the modern-day advancements in artificial intelligence, technology has been instrumental in shaping human history. Its impact on society can be traced through several key milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prehistoric Era</strong>: Early humans used simple tools and fire for survival. These rudimentary technologies were the first steps in man&rsquo;s ability to control and alter his environment.</li>
<li><strong>Agricultural Revolution</strong>: The development of agricultural tools, irrigation systems, and the domestication of animals led to the establishment of settled societies, transforming human civilization.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial Revolution</strong>: The invention of machinery and the mechanization of labor revolutionized society by introducing mass production, leading to urbanization, social stratification, and the creation of modern economies.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Revolution</strong>: The advent of computers, the internet, and mobile technology has redefined communication, information sharing, and work dynamics, creating the modern &ldquo;information society.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

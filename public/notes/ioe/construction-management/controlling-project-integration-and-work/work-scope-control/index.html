<p>Work scope control is a critical process in construction project management that ensures the project stays on track by managing and controlling the scope. Effective scope control helps prevent &ldquo;scope creep&rdquo; and ensures that all tasks are completed as defined in the project&rsquo;s scope, on time, and within budget. By monitoring and controlling the scope throughout the project, project managers can reduce the risks of unexpected changes that could impact project performance.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-importance-of-work-scope-control">1. <strong>Importance of Work Scope Control</strong></h2>
<p>Work scope control is essential for the following reasons:</p>

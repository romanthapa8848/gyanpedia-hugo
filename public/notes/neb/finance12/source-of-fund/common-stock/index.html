<p>Common stock represents ownership in a company and constitutes a claim on part of the company’s assets and earnings. Stockholders, also known as shareholders, are typically entitled to vote on important company matters, including elections to the board of directors and other major corporate decisions. Common stockholders may also receive dividends, though these are not guaranteed, and the amount may vary.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="features-of-common-stock"><strong>Features of Common Stock</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ownership</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common stock represents a claim on a company’s assets and earnings. The ownership stake is proportionate to the number of shares held.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voting Rights</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common stockholders generally have voting rights in the company. They can vote on corporate matters such as electing the board of directors, mergers, or changes in company policies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dividends on common stock are not fixed. They are declared by the company’s board of directors and are distributed from the company’s profits. However, the company is not obligated to pay dividends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Residual Claim</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In case of liquidation, common stockholders are paid after all debt holders and preferred stockholders have been compensated. This means they take on more risk but also have the potential for higher returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Appreciation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common stockholders have the potential for capital appreciation, meaning the value of the stock may increase over time if the company performs well, leading to a higher stock price.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Right to Transfer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common stock can be freely bought and sold in the stock market, offering liquidity to investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="advantages-of-common-stock"><strong>Advantages of Common Stock</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential for High Returns</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common stockholders can benefit from significant capital appreciation if the company’s stock price increases. They also benefit from dividends if declared.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voting Rights</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common stockholders have the power to vote on important company matters, providing them with a say in the company’s future direction and management.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Liability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>As an equity investor, common stockholders&rsquo; liability is limited to the amount they invested in the company. They cannot lose more than the value of their shares.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access to Corporate Profits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shareholders are entitled to a share of the company’s profits, which are distributed in the form of dividends. In the long term, companies may also grow, increasing the value of their shares.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liquidity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common stock is generally highly liquid, as it can be easily bought and sold in public markets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-common-stock"><strong>Disadvantages of Common Stock</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk of Loss</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common stockholders bear the highest risk in a company. If the company performs poorly or goes bankrupt, common stockholders may lose their entire investment, as they are last in line to be compensated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends are Not Guaranteed</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike preferred stockholders, common stockholders may not receive dividends, especially if the company is not performing well or chooses to reinvest profits rather than distribute them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Volatility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of common stock can fluctuate significantly, sometimes making it an unpredictable investment. Stock prices are influenced by many factors, including market conditions, economic conditions, and company performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Control</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>While common stockholders have voting rights, they may not have enough influence over major company decisions, especially if they hold a small number of shares.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dilution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a company issues additional shares of common stock, the ownership percentage of existing shareholders is diluted. This can reduce their voting power and share of dividends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Common stock represents a way for investors to share in a company’s growth and profits. While it provides the potential for high returns, it also comes with significant risk, particularly in case of liquidation. Shareholders may enjoy voting rights and access to dividends, but these are not guaranteed. Overall, common stock is ideal for investors willing to take on higher risk for the possibility of substantial rewards.</p>

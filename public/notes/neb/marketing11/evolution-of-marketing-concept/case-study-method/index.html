<p>The <strong>Case Study Method</strong> is a qualitative research technique widely used in marketing research. It involves an in-depth examination of a particular instance, situation, or case within its real-life context. The method is used to analyze and understand complex issues, business practices, and decision-making processes by studying actual business scenarios, events, or problems in detail. The case study method is particularly useful for understanding challenges, identifying opportunities, and drawing lessons from real-life examples.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The <strong>Internal Records System</strong> is a key component of the <strong>Marketing Information System (MIS)</strong>. It focuses on collecting, storing, and managing internal data generated from within the organization. This system plays a vital role in providing timely and accurate information about business operations, such as sales performance, inventory levels, and customer data. By analyzing this internal information, businesses can gain insights into their day-to-day activities, improve efficiency, and make informed decisions.</p>

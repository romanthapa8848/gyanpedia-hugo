<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A <strong>Decision Support System (DSS)</strong> is a computer-based system that supports decision-making activities in an organization. It helps managers make decisions by providing relevant data, analytical tools, and models to analyze information. DSS integrates data from various sources to assist in solving complex problems, supporting both strategic and operational decisions. In marketing, DSS can be used for making decisions related to customer segmentation, pricing strategies, market analysis, and more.</p>

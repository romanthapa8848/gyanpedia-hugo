<p>Wholesalers are intermediaries who purchase goods in bulk from manufacturers and sell them in smaller quantities to retailers or other businesses. They typically do not sell directly to consumers but act as a crucial link between manufacturers and retailers or other businesses in the distribution chain. Wholesalers play a vital role in the smooth flow of goods and services from production to consumption.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="types-of-wholesalers">Types of Wholesalers</h2>
<h3 id="1-merchant-wholesalers">1. Merchant Wholesalers</h3>
<p><strong>Merchant wholesalers</strong> are independent businesses that take ownership of the goods they buy and sell. They usually buy products in large quantities from manufacturers and sell them in smaller lots to retailers or other wholesalers. They assume the risks associated with the products they handle, including warehousing and distribution.</p>
<h4 id="features">Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ownership of Goods</strong>: They purchase products and take title to the goods.</li>
<li><strong>Bulk Buying and Selling</strong>: They buy products in bulk and sell them in smaller quantities.</li>
<li><strong>Risk-Bearing</strong>: They take on the risks related to storage and market fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example">Example:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A wholesaler that buys electronics in bulk from manufacturers and sells them to local retail stores.</li>

<h3 id="3-manufacturer-wholesalers-manufacturers-sales-branches">3. Manufacturer-Wholesalers (Manufacturer&rsquo;s Sales Branches)</h3>
<p><strong>Manufacturer-wholesalers</strong>, also known as <strong>manufacturer&rsquo;s sales branches</strong>, are wholesaling arms of manufacturers. They sell the company’s own products directly to retailers, other wholesalers, or business customers, bypassing independent wholesalers. These are owned and operated by the manufacturer.</p>
<h4 id="features-2">Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manufacturer-Owned</strong>: They are directly owned and operated by the manufacturer.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Selling</strong>: They sell the manufacturer&rsquo;s own products to retailers or other businesses.</li>

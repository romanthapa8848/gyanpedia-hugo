<p>Agents are intermediaries who act on behalf of manufacturers or sellers and help facilitate the marketing and sale of products. They play a crucial role in connecting producers with buyers and handling various aspects of the marketing process. Agents do not take ownership of the goods they sell; instead, they work on a commission or fee basis for their services.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-agents">Types of Agents</h2>
<h3 id="1-manufacturers-agent">1. Manufacturer&rsquo;s Agent</h3>
<p>A <strong>manufacturer&rsquo;s agent</strong> represents a manufacturer and sells products on their behalf in a specific geographical area. These agents typically have a long-term relationship with the manufacturer and work exclusively for them.</p>
<h4 id="features">Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exclusive Representation</strong>: They represent a specific manufacturer in a designated area.</li>
<li><strong>Commission-Based</strong>: They earn a commission for the sales they generate.</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="example">Example:</h4>

<h4 id="features-1">Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exclusive Rights</strong>: They have the sole right to market and sell a product in a particular region.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Agreement</strong>: Sole agents often have long-term contracts with manufacturers.</li>

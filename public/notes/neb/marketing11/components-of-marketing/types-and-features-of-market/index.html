<p>Markets have several common features that define how they function and operate. These features include:</p>
<h3 id="1-buyers-and-sellers">1. Buyers and Sellers</h3>
<p>A market requires at least two parties: buyers and sellers. Buyers seek to purchase goods or services, while sellers offer products in exchange for money or value.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-exchange-process">2. Exchange Process</h3>
<p>The core of any market is the exchange process, where buyers and sellers trade goods, services, or information. This exchange could be for money or barter.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-demand-and-supply">3. Demand and Supply</h3>
<p>The forces of <strong>demand</strong> and <strong>supply</strong> are central to the functioning of a market. The price and quantity of goods and services in a market are determined by the interaction of demand (consumer wants) and supply (availability of goods).</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-price-mechanism">4. Price Mechanism</h3>

<hr>
<h3 id="6-legal-framework">6. Legal Framework</h3>
<p>Most markets operate under a set of legal and regulatory rules. These laws ensure that the market operates fairly, preventing unfair trade practices, fraud, and exploitation.</p>

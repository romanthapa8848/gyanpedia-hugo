         <h1 id="formative-evaluation">Formative Evaluation</h1>
<p>Formative evaluation refers to the ongoing assessment conducted during the instructional process to monitor students&rsquo; learning progress and provide feedback for improvement. Unlike summative evaluation, which takes place at the end of an instructional period, formative evaluation is used to make real-time adjustments to teaching and learning, helping students improve as they progress. It focuses on learning in progress rather than just the final outcome.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-formative-evaluation">Purpose of Formative Evaluation</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of formative evaluation is to identify students&rsquo; strengths and areas of difficulty during the learning process. This allows teachers to adjust instruction, provide additional support, and help students improve their understanding of the material before final assessments.</p>
<h3 id="key-features">Key Features:</h3>

</ol>
<h2 id="examples-of-formative-evaluation">Examples of Formative Evaluation</h2>

<li><strong>Weekly Quizzes:</strong> Short quizzes that assess the material taught that week help track individual student progress and highlight areas for review.</li>
<li><strong>Homework Assignments:</strong> Regular assignments that focus on applying what students have learned help assess understanding and offer opportunities for revision.</li>
<li><strong>Group Work and Presentations:</strong> Collaborative activities that require students to present their ideas or solutions provide an opportunity for both peer and teacher evaluation.</li>

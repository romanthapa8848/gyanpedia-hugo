<p>Attendance refers to the act of being present in class for scheduled lessons or educational activities. It is a critical factor in the academic success of students and plays a significant role in determining their participation, learning progress, and overall performance. Consistent attendance helps students stay engaged, develop a better understanding of the material, and interact with their peers and instructors.</p>

<li><strong>Transportation Issues</strong>: Inadequate transportation options or long distances can make it difficult for students to attend class on time.</li>

<li><strong>Increased Dropout Risk</strong>: Chronic absenteeism is often linked to a higher risk of dropping out of school or college.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="measuring-attendance">Measuring Attendance</h3>
<p>Attendance can be tracked using various methods, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual Roll Call</strong>: Teachers can take attendance at the beginning of each class by calling out names.</li>

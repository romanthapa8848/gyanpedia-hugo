<p>Class work and participation are essential elements of the learning process that involve active engagement between students and teachers. These aspects play a crucial role in the development of a student’s knowledge, skills, and overall learning experience. They offer opportunities for students to demonstrate their understanding, share ideas, and engage in collaborative learning within the classroom setting.</p>

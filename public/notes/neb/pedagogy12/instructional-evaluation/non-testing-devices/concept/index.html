<p>Non-testing devices are alternative methods used for evaluating students&rsquo; knowledge, skills, and progress without relying on traditional tests or exams. These tools are designed to provide a more holistic view of student learning and can be used to assess various aspects of a student&rsquo;s development, such as creativity, participation, and practical application of knowledge.</p>
<p>Non-testing devices include observations, portfolios, projects, interviews, self-assessments, and peer assessments, among others. These tools are valuable because they can assess students&rsquo; abilities in real-life scenarios and provide more personalized and comprehensive feedback.</p>

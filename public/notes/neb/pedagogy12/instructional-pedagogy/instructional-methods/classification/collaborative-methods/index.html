         <h1 id="collaborative-methods">Collaborative Methods</h1>
<p>Collaborative instructional methods are designed to foster interaction and cooperation among students to achieve shared learning goals. In these methods, students work together in small groups or teams to explore concepts, solve problems, and complete tasks. The emphasis is on cooperation, communication, and shared responsibility for the learning process. Collaborative learning not only promotes academic skills but also social and emotional development as students learn to work effectively with others.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-collaborative-methods">Types of Collaborative Methods</h3>
<ol>

<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Each student becomes an “expert” on a portion of the topic and teaches that part to their group members.</li>
<li><strong>When to Use</strong>: Best for dividing a large topic into manageable chunks and ensuring active engagement from all students.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Encourages individual responsibility and accountability.</li>

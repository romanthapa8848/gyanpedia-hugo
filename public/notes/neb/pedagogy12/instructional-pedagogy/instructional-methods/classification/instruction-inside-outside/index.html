         <h1 id="instruction-inside-and-outside-the-classroom">Instruction Inside and Outside the Classroom</h1>
<p>Instruction is not limited to the four walls of a classroom. While traditional instruction focuses on the delivery of content inside the classroom, the scope of effective teaching extends beyond this space. Instruction inside the classroom typically involves direct teacher-student interactions, structured lessons, and activities that foster engagement and understanding. However, learning can also take place outside the classroom in various forms, including field trips, community learning, and project-based assignments. Both inside and outside instructional approaches are important to provide a well-rounded educational experience.</p>

         <h1 id="a-v-materials">A-V Materials</h1>
<p>Audio-Visual (A-V) materials combine both auditory and visual elements to facilitate learning. These instructional resources use sound and images to enhance the communication of information and make learning more engaging. A-V materials can include videos, films, slideshows, audio recordings, and interactive media. They are effective tools for conveying complex concepts, capturing students&rsquo; attention, and supporting diverse learning styles.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-a-v-materials">Types of A-V Materials</h2>
<p>A-V materials can be categorized based on the combination of audio and visual components they utilize. The most commonly used types of A-V materials include:</p>

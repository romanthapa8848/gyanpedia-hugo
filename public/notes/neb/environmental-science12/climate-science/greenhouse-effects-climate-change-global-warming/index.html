<p>The <strong>greenhouse effect</strong> is a natural process that warms the Earth’s surface. Without it, the planet would be too cold to support life. However, human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to an enhanced greenhouse effect, which causes <strong>climate change</strong> and <strong>global warming</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="greenhouse-effect">Greenhouse Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>greenhouse effect</strong> occurs when certain gases in the Earth’s atmosphere trap heat from the Sun. These gases include <strong>carbon dioxide (CO₂)</strong>, <strong>methane (CH₄)</strong>, <strong>nitrous oxide (N₂O)</strong>, and <strong>water vapor (H₂O)</strong>.</li>
<li>Solar radiation from the Sun reaches the Earth, where it is absorbed by the surface. Some of this energy is then radiated back towards space as infrared radiation (heat). Greenhouse gases absorb and re-radiate this heat, keeping the Earth warmer than it would be without them.</li>
<li>The greenhouse effect is essential for life, as it keeps the Earth’s average temperature at about 15°C. Without it, the Earth’s average temperature would be around -18°C, too cold to support most life.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="climate-change">Climate Change</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate change</strong> refers to long-term changes in the average temperature and weather patterns of the Earth. While the Earth’s climate has always experienced natural variations, human activities have significantly accelerated the rate of change.</li>
<li>The primary cause of current climate change is the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting from activities such as <strong>deforestation</strong>, <strong>industrial emissions</strong>, and <strong>burning of fossil fuels</strong>.</li>
<li>Climate change affects various aspects of the Earth’s climate, including temperature patterns, precipitation levels, and the frequency of extreme weather events.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="global-warming">Global Warming</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global warming</strong> is the increase in the Earth&rsquo;s average surface temperature due to the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</li>
<li>The primary cause of global warming is the increased concentration of <strong>carbon dioxide (CO₂)</strong>, which is primarily released from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes.</li>
<li>Other greenhouse gases, like <strong>methane (CH₄)</strong>, which is emitted by livestock and the decay of organic waste, and <strong>nitrous oxide (N₂O)</strong>, released from agricultural activities, also contribute to global warming.</li>
</ul>

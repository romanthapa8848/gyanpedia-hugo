         <h1 id="global-distribution-of-water">Global Distribution of Water</h1>
<p>Water is one of the most essential resources on Earth, yet it is unevenly distributed across the planet. Around 71% of the Earth&rsquo;s surface is covered by water, but only a small fraction of it is available for human use. The global distribution of water can be categorized into different types, primarily freshwater and saltwater.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="major-categories-of-water">Major Categories of Water</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Saltwater</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vast majority of Earth&rsquo;s water, about 97.5%, is found in the oceans in the form of saltwater. This water is not directly usable for drinking or irrigation without desalination due to its high salt content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Freshwater</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 2.5% of the Earth&rsquo;s water is freshwater. However, a significant portion of this freshwater is locked in glaciers, ice caps, or deep underground in aquifers, making it difficult to access. Only about 0.3% of the total water on Earth is available as surface freshwater.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Surface Water</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freshwater available on the Earth&rsquo;s surface is found in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. This small fraction of the global water supply is crucial for agricultural, industrial, and domestic purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Groundwater</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Groundwater is a significant source of freshwater stored beneath the Earth&rsquo;s surface. It accounts for a large portion of the usable freshwater but is often difficult and costly to access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="distribution-of-water-on-earth">Distribution of Water on Earth</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oceans</strong>: 97.5%</li>
<li><strong>Ice Caps and Glaciers</strong>: 68.7% (of freshwater)</li>
<li><strong>Groundwater</strong>: 30.1% (of freshwater)</li>
<li><strong>Surface Water</strong>: 0.3% (of freshwater)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Water is primarily found in the oceans as saltwater, with only a small portion available as freshwater for human use. The accessibility of this freshwater is further limited by the fact that most of it is either frozen in ice caps or deeply stored underground.</p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<h3 id="1-how-much-of-earths-water-is-saltwater">1. How much of Earth&rsquo;s water is saltwater?</h3>
<p><strong>97.5%</strong> of Earth&rsquo;s water is saltwater, found mainly in the oceans.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-percentage-of-earths-water-is-freshwater">2. What percentage of Earth&rsquo;s water is freshwater?</h3>
<p>Only <strong>2.5%</strong> of Earth&rsquo;s total water is freshwater.</p>
<h3 id="3-where-is-most-of-earths-freshwater-stored">3. Where is most of Earth&rsquo;s freshwater stored?</h3>
<p>Most of Earth&rsquo;s freshwater is stored in <strong>glaciers and ice caps</strong> (about 68.7%).</p>
<h3 id="4-how-much-of-the-earths-freshwater-is-available-for-human-use">4. How much of the Earth&rsquo;s freshwater is available for human use?</h3>
<p>Only about <strong>0.3%</strong> of Earth&rsquo;s freshwater is available as surface water for human use.</p>
<h3 id="5-what-is-the-main-source-of-freshwater-for-drinking-and-agriculture">5. What is the main source of freshwater for drinking and agriculture?</h3>
<p>The primary source of freshwater is <strong>surface water</strong> found in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs.</p>
<h3 id="6-what-is-groundwater">6. What is groundwater?</h3>
<p><strong>Groundwater</strong> is water stored underground, often in aquifers, and accounts for a large portion of usable freshwater.</p>
<h3 id="7-why-is-ocean-water-not-suitable-for-drinking">7. Why is ocean water not suitable for drinking?</h3>
<p>Ocean water contains high levels of <strong>salt</strong>, which makes it unsuitable for drinking without desalination.</p>
<h3 id="8-how-do-glaciers-and-ice-caps-contribute-to-the-global-water-supply">8. How do glaciers and ice caps contribute to the global water supply?</h3>
<p><strong>Glaciers and ice caps</strong> hold a large amount of the world&rsquo;s freshwater, but it is mostly inaccessible due to its frozen state.</p>
<h3 id="9-how-does-the-distribution-of-water-affect-water-scarcity">9. How does the distribution of water affect water scarcity?</h3>
<p>The uneven distribution of water, with vast amounts in the oceans and limited accessible freshwater, leads to <strong>water scarcity</strong> in many regions.</p>
<h3 id="10-can-we-use-all-the-freshwater-on-earth">10. Can we use all the freshwater on Earth?</h3>
<p>Not all freshwater is easily accessible. Much of it is stored as <strong>groundwater</strong> or frozen in glaciers, which limits its availability for human use.</p>

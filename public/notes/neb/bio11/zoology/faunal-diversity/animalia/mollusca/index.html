         <h1 id="mollusca-diagnostic-features-and-classification-up-to-class-with-examples">Mollusca: Diagnostic Features and Classification Up to Class with Examples</h1>
<p>Mollusca is one of the largest and most diverse phyla of invertebrates, including organisms such as snails, clams, and octopuses. Mollusks inhabit marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments and are characterized by their soft, unsegmented bodies, often protected by a calcareous shell.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="diagnostic-features">Diagnostic Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Soft, Unsegmented Body:</strong><br>
Mollusks have a <strong>soft body</strong>, which is typically unsegmented and divided into three main regions: the head-foot, visceral mass, and mantle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mantle:</strong><br>
The <strong>mantle</strong> is a significant body part that secretes the calcareous shell (if present) and often forms a mantle cavity housing gills or lungs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Muscular Foot:</strong><br>
Mollusks possess a <strong>muscular foot</strong> used for locomotion, attachment, or capturing prey. The shape and function of the foot vary among different classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calcareous Shell:</strong><br>
Most mollusks have an external <strong>calcareous shell</strong> made of calcium carbonate, although some, like octopuses, lack a shell entirely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Radula:</strong><br>
A specialized feeding structure called the <strong>radula</strong> (a toothed, chitinous ribbon) is present in most mollusks, except bivalves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coelom:</strong><br>
Mollusks have a reduced <strong>coelom</strong>, restricted mainly to the pericardial area and cavities around the gonads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Circulatory System:</strong><br>
The circulatory system is usually <strong>open</strong>, with the hemolymph bathing the internal organs directly. Cephalopods are an exception, having a closed circulatory system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Respiration:</strong><br>
Respiration occurs through <strong>gills</strong> (ctenidia) in aquatic mollusks or through a <strong>lung</strong> in terrestrial species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nervous System:</strong><br>
The nervous system ranges from simple nerve networks in bivalves to a highly developed system in cephalopods, with complex brains and advanced sensory organs.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="classification-up-to-class-with-examples">Classification Up to Class with Examples</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Gastropoda (Snails and Slugs)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Features:</strong><br>
Gastropods are the largest class of mollusks, characterized by a single, often spirally coiled shell (though some species are shell-less). They undergo a developmental process called <strong>torsion</strong>, where the body twists during growth.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Helix aspersa</em> (Garden Snail): Common terrestrial snail.</li>
<li><em>Lymnaea</em> (Pond Snail): Found in freshwater habitats.</li>
<li><em>Aplysia</em> (Sea Hare): A marine gastropod known for ink secretion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Bivalvia (Bivalves)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Features:</strong><br>
Bivalves have a body enclosed by a shell consisting of two hinged valves. They lack a radula and are mostly filter feeders, using gills to extract food particles from the water.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Mytilus edulis</em> (Blue Mussel): A commonly found edible mussel.</li>
<li><em>Pinctada</em> (Pearl Oyster): Known for pearl formation.</li>
<li><em>Tridacna gigas</em> (Giant Clam): One of the largest bivalves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Cephalopoda (Squids, Octopuses, and Cuttlefish)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Features:</strong><br>
Cephalopods are highly advanced mollusks, known for their well-developed brains, large eyes, and closed circulatory systems. They have tentacles with suckers and a beak-like jaw for feeding. The shell is either internal (cuttlefish, squid), reduced (octopus), or external (nautilus).</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Octopus vulgaris</em> (Common Octopus): Known for its intelligence and ability to change color.</li>
<li><em>Loligo</em> (Squid): Widely used in scientific studies and as food.</li>
<li><em>Nautilus pompilius</em> (Chambered Nautilus): The only living cephalopod with an external shell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Polyplacophora (Chitons)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Features:</strong><br>
Chitons have an oval, dorsoventrally flattened body with a shell composed of eight articulated plates. They cling to rocks in intertidal zones, using a strong, muscular foot.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Chiton</em> (Chiton): A marine mollusk found in rocky habitats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Scaphopoda (Tusk Shells)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Features:</strong><br>
Scaphopods have a tubular, tusk-shaped shell open at both ends. They live buried in sand, with a foot used for digging and tentacles (captacula) for capturing food.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Dentalium</em> (Tusk Shell): A burrowing marine mollusk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-what-is-the-main-characteristic-feature-of-mollusca">1. What is the main characteristic feature of Mollusca?</h3>
<p>Mollusca is characterized by a soft, unsegmented body, often enclosed within a calcareous shell, and the presence of a mantle.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-is-the-radula-and-which-mollusks-have-it">2. What is the radula, and which mollusks have it?</h3>

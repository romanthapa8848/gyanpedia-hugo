<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms. It explores the structure, function, growth, evolution, and interaction of life forms at various levels—from the molecular to the ecosystem. The scope of biology is vast, encompassing numerous subfields and linking closely with other scientific disciplines.</p>
<h2 id="scope-of-biology">Scope of Biology</h2>
<p>Biology covers a wide range of topics, from studying the smallest units of life, such as cells, to understanding entire ecosystems. The scope of biology includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cellular Biology</strong>: Study of cells, the basic units of life.</li>
<li><strong>Genetics</strong>: Study of heredity and variation in organisms.</li>
<li><strong>Ecology</strong>: Study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment.</li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary Biology</strong>: Study of how species evolve over time.</li>
<li><strong>Molecular Biology</strong>: Study of biological molecules like DNA and proteins.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-branches-of-biology">Key Branches of Biology:</h3>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Oparin-Haldane Theory proposes that life on Earth originated through a process called <strong>chemical evolution</strong>. This theory, independently proposed by <strong>Alexander Oparin</strong> and <strong>J.B.S. Haldane</strong> in the 1920s, suggests that simple organic compounds could have formed spontaneously from inorganic molecules under the conditions of early Earth. Over time, these compounds developed into more complex molecules and eventually life.</p>
<h2 id="key-concepts-of-the-oparin-haldane-theory">Key Concepts of the Oparin-Haldane Theory</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Early Earth&rsquo;s Atmosphere</strong>: The theory suggests that Earth&rsquo;s early atmosphere was <strong>reducing</strong> (lacking free oxygen) and rich in gases like methane ($CH_4$), ammonia ($NH_3$), hydrogen ($H_2$), and water vapor ($H_2O$).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primordial Soup</strong>: In this environment, these gases could have reacted, driven by energy from sunlight or lightning, forming <strong>organic molecules</strong> like amino acids, which accumulated in Earth&rsquo;s oceans, forming a &ldquo;primordial soup.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Formation of Complex Molecules</strong>: Over time, these organic molecules underwent further chemical reactions, leading to more complex compounds, including <strong>proteins</strong> and <strong>nucleic acids</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abiogenesis</strong>: Eventually, these complex molecules organized into self-replicating systems, marking the beginning of life. This process, known as <strong>abiogenesis</strong>, explains how life could have emerged from non-living matter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-miller-urey-experiment">The Miller-Urey Experiment</h2>
<p>In 1953, <strong>Stanley Miller</strong> and <strong>Harold Urey</strong> conducted an experiment that supported the Oparin-Haldane Theory. They recreated the conditions of early Earth in a laboratory by mixing water vapor, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen and exposing them to an electric spark (to simulate lightning). After a few days, they found that <strong>amino acids</strong>, the building blocks of proteins, had formed. This experiment provided evidence that organic molecules could be synthesized from simple inorganic compounds under early Earth-like conditions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The Oparin-Haldane Theory suggests that life originated through a gradual process of chemical evolution in Earth&rsquo;s early atmosphere, which was rich in gases like methane and ammonia. Organic molecules, formed in the &ldquo;primordial soup,&rdquo; eventually led to the development of self-replicating systems, marking the beginning of life. The Miller-Urey experiment provided experimental support for this theory by showing that amino acids could form under conditions similar to those of early Earth.</p>

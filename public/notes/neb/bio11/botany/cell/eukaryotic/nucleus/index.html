The outer membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), allowing for direct communication between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. This connection facilitates the transport of proteins and RNA molecules synthesized in the ER.</li>
<li><strong>Pore Complexes:</strong> The nuclear envelope is perforated by nuclear pore complexes, which are large protein assemblies that span the double membrane. These pores regulate the selective transport of molecules, allowing small ions and molecules to pass freely while controlling the passage of larger proteins and RNA. This selective permeability is crucial for maintaining the distinct environments of the nucleus and cytoplasm.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-chromatin-organization">b. Chromatin Organization</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Euchromatin:</strong> Euchromatin is the lightly packed form of chromatin that is transcriptionally active. Its loose configuration allows access to DNA for transcription, facilitating the synthesis of mRNA and other RNA molecules necessary for protein production. This dynamic state of chromatin can change in response to cellular signals, reflecting the cell&rsquo;s transcriptional activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heterochromatin:</strong> In contrast, heterochromatin is densely packed and transcriptionally inactive. This tightly coiled form of chromatin serves structural functions, ensuring that the DNA remains protected and stable during cell division. Heterochromatin is often found at the periphery of the nucleus and plays a role in gene regulation by silencing specific gene regions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-nucleolus">c. Nucleolus</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visible in Interphase:</strong> The nucleolus is a prominent, non-membrane-bound structure within the nucleus, particularly visible during interphase (the non-dividing state of the cell). It appears as a dark spot under the microscope due to its high concentration of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins. The size and visibility of the nucleolus can vary depending on the metabolic activity of the cell, being more prominent in cells that are actively synthesizing proteins.</li>

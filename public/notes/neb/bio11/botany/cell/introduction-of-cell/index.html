<h2 id="a-cell-membrane">a. Cell Membrane</h2>
<p>The cell membrane, or plasma membrane, is a semi-permeable barrier that surrounds the cell, protecting its internal environment and regulating the movement of substances in and out of the cell.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Composition:</strong> It is primarily composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins, cholesterol, and carbohydrates. The hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails of phospholipids face inward, while the hydrophilic (water-attracting) heads face outward, creating a stable yet fluid environment.</li>
<li><strong>Functions:</strong> The membrane&rsquo;s proteins serve various functions, including acting as channels and transporters for molecules, receptors for signaling, and enzymes for biochemical reactions. The cell membrane is essential for maintaining homeostasis by controlling the influx and efflux of ions, nutrients, and waste products.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="b-cytoplasm">b. Cytoplasm</h2>
<p>The cytoplasm is a gel-like substance that fills the interior of the cell, containing organelles, enzymes, and various molecules necessary for cellular functions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Composition:</strong> It is composed primarily of water, salts, and organic molecules, forming a colloidal solution that supports the structure of organelles. The cytoskeleton, a network of protein filaments, provides structural support and helps maintain cell shape.</li>
<li><strong>Functions:</strong> The cytoplasm provides a medium for biochemical reactions to occur, allowing metabolic processes, such as glycolysis and protein synthesis, to take place. It also facilitates the movement of materials within the cell and plays a role in cellular signaling.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="c-nucleus">c. Nucleus</h2>
<p>The nucleus is the control center of the cell, housing genetic material (DNA) and coordinating activities such as growth, metabolism, and reproduction.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure:</strong> It is surrounded by a double membrane known as the nuclear envelope, which contains nuclear pores that regulate the transport of molecules in and out of the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, chromatin (a complex of DNA and proteins) condenses to form chromosomes during cell division.</li>
<li><strong>Functions:</strong> The nucleus is responsible for storing and protecting genetic information, directing cellular activities through gene expression, and coordinating cell division through the replication and distribution of DNA.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="d-organelles">d. Organelles</h2>
<p>Cells contain various organelles, each with specific functions essential for cellular operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mitochondria:</strong> The powerhouse of the cell, responsible for energy production through cellular respiration. Mitochondria convert glucose and oxygen into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of the cell. They have their own DNA, suggesting an evolutionary origin from free-living prokaryotes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ribosomes:</strong> Sites of protein synthesis, translating genetic information from mRNA into proteins. Ribosomes can be found free-floating in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), depending on the type of proteins being synthesized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rough ER:</strong> Studded with ribosomes, it is involved in the synthesis and transport of proteins destined for secretion or for use within the cell. It plays a key role in the post-translational modification of proteins.</li>
<li><strong>Smooth ER:</strong> Lacks ribosomes and is involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification of drugs and poisons, and storage of calcium ions. It is essential for maintaining lipid balance and cellular detoxification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Golgi Apparatus:</strong> A series of flattened membrane-bound sacs that modify, sort, and package proteins and lipids for secretion or use within the cell. It plays a critical role in glycosylation (addition of carbohydrates) and the production of lysosomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lysosomes:</strong> Membrane-bound organelles that contain digestive enzymes to break down waste materials and cellular debris. They play a key role in recycling cellular components through autophagy and in the degradation of macromolecules. Lysosomes are essential for cellular homeostasis and defense against pathogens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="e-cytoskeleton">e. Cytoskeleton</h2>
<p>The cytoskeleton is a dynamic network of protein filaments and tubules that provides structural support, maintains cell shape, and facilitates cell movement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Components:</strong> It is composed of three main types of filaments:
<ul>
<li><strong>Microfilaments:</strong> Made of actin, they are involved in cell movement, muscle contraction, and cell division.</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate Filaments:</strong> Provide mechanical strength and stability to the cell, helping to maintain its shape and protect against stress.</li>
<li><strong>Microtubules:</strong> Hollow tubes made of tubulin, involved in maintaining cell shape, intracellular transport, and forming the spindle apparatus during cell division.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The cytoskeleton is crucial for various cellular functions, including motility, intracellular transport, and maintaining the overall integrity of the cell structure.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="2-types-of-cells">2. Types of Cells</h1>
<p>Cells can be broadly categorized into two main types: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Each type has distinct characteristics, structures, and functions that are essential for life.</p>
<h2 id="a-prokaryotic-cells">a. Prokaryotic Cells</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Prokaryotic cells are simple, unicellular organisms that lack a defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Their genetic material is located in a region called the nucleoid, which is not separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane. The cell wall provides structural support and protection, while the plasma membrane regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Common examples of prokaryotic cells include bacteria and archaea. Bacteria are diverse and can be found in various environments, while archaea often inhabit extreme conditions, such as hot springs and salty lakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Prokaryotic cells carry out essential life processes, such as metabolism, respiration, and reproduction, through mechanisms that are generally less complex than those found in eukaryotic cells. They reproduce primarily through binary fission, a process where the cell divides into two identical daughter cells. Despite their simplicity, prokaryotes play crucial roles in ecosystems, including nutrient cycling and decomposition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="b-eukaryotic-cells">b. Eukaryotic Cells</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Eukaryotic cells are more complex and larger than prokaryotic cells, characterized by a defined nucleus that houses the cell&rsquo;s genetic material (DNA) and membrane-bound organelles that perform specialized functions. The presence of a cytoskeleton provides structural support and facilitates intracellular transport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Eukaryotic cells include a variety of organisms, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plant Cells:</strong> Contain chloroplasts for photosynthesis, a rigid cell wall for structure, and large central vacuoles for storage and maintaining turgor pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Animal Cells:</strong> Lack a cell wall and chloroplasts, are generally more flexible, and contain small vacuoles. They often have specialized structures like cilia and flagella for movement.</li>
<li><strong>Fungi:</strong> Have cell walls made of chitin and can exist as unicellular (yeasts) or multicellular (molds and mushrooms) organisms. They play key roles in decomposition and nutrient recycling.</li>
<li><strong>Protists:</strong> A diverse group of mostly unicellular organisms that can be plant-like (algae), animal-like (protozoa), or fungus-like (slime molds). Protists exhibit various modes of nutrition and can live in aquatic or moist environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Eukaryotic cells perform specialized functions that allow for greater complexity and organization in multicellular organisms. These functions include cell signaling, tissue formation, and the development of specialized cell types that contribute to the organism&rsquo;s overall function. Eukaryotic cells can engage in sexual and asexual reproduction, leading to genetic diversity and adaptation.</p>

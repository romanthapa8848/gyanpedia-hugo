         <h1 id="introduction-and-functions-of-proteins">Introduction and Functions of Proteins</h1>
<p>Proteins are essential macromolecules composed of amino acids, which are linked together by peptide bonds. They play a crucial role in virtually every biological process, acting as enzymes, structural components, and signaling molecules. Proteins are involved in cell structure, function, and regulation of the body&rsquo;s tissues and organs, making them vital for life.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-functions-of-proteins">1. Functions of Proteins</h2>
<h3 id="a-enzymatic-activity">a. Enzymatic Activity</h3>
<p>Proteins function as enzymes, catalyzing biochemical reactions that are essential for metabolic processes. Enzymes lower the activation energy required for reactions, increasing the rate at which they occur.</p>
<h3 id="b-structural-support">b. Structural Support</h3>
<p>Proteins provide structural support to cells and tissues. Collagen, for example, is a protein that forms the connective tissue in skin, tendons, and ligaments, providing strength and elasticity.</p>
<h3 id="c-transport">c. Transport</h3>
<p>Many proteins act as transport molecules, carrying essential substances throughout the body. Hemoglobin is a well-known transport protein that binds and carries oxygen in the bloodstream.</p>
<h3 id="d-immune-response">d. Immune Response</h3>
<p>Proteins play a critical role in the immune system. Antibodies are proteins that identify and neutralize pathogens, helping to protect the body from infections and diseases.</p>

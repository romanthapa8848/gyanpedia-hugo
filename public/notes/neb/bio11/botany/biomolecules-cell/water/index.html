         <h1 id="introduction-and-functions-of-water">Introduction and Functions of Water</h1>
<p>Water is a vital substance for all forms of life, making up a significant portion of living organisms. It is a unique molecule composed of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to one oxygen atom, giving it distinctive properties that make it essential for biological processes. Water serves as a solvent, a temperature regulator, and a participant in numerous biochemical reactions, playing a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis within organisms.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-functions-of-water">1. Functions of Water</h2>
<h3 id="a-solvent-properties">a. Solvent Properties</h3>
<p>Water is often referred to as the &ldquo;universal solvent&rdquo; because it can dissolve a wide variety of substances, including salts, sugars, acids, and gases. This property facilitates chemical reactions and nutrient transport within cells and throughout organisms.</p>
<h3 id="b-temperature-regulation">b. Temperature Regulation</h3>
<p>Water has a high specific heat capacity, meaning it can absorb and retain heat without a significant change in temperature. This property helps regulate internal body temperatures in organisms, providing a stable environment for cellular functions.</p>
<h3 id="c-participation-in-chemical-reactions">c. Participation in Chemical Reactions</h3>
<p>Water is involved in various biochemical reactions, including hydrolysis and dehydration synthesis. It serves as a reactant in metabolic processes, breaking down complex molecules and aiding in the synthesis of new compounds.</p>
<h3 id="d-structural-support">d. Structural Support</h3>
<p>Water provides turgor pressure in plant cells, helping maintain structural integrity and support. It also acts as a lubricant in joints, reducing friction and facilitating smooth movement.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-properties-of-water">2. Properties of Water</h2>
<h3 id="a-polarity">a. Polarity</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Water molecules exhibit polarity due to the unequal sharing of electrons between oxygen and hydrogen atoms, leading to a partial positive charge on hydrogen and a partial negative charge on oxygen.</li>
<li><strong>Function:</strong> Polarity allows water to form hydrogen bonds, which contribute to its unique properties.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-cohesion-and-adhesion">b. Cohesion and Adhesion</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Cohesion refers to the attraction between water molecules, while adhesion describes the attraction between water molecules and other substances.</li>
<li><strong>Function:</strong> These properties are essential for processes like capillary action, which enables water to move through plant vessels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-density">c. Density</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Water is unique in that it is less dense as a solid (ice) than as a liquid, allowing ice to float on water.</li>
<li><strong>Function:</strong> This property insulates aquatic environments, protecting organisms from freezing temperatures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Business activities are classified into various dimensions that reflect their nature and purpose. Two key dimensions of business are <strong>Service</strong> and <strong>Commerce</strong>. These dimensions contribute to the overall growth and development of economies around the world.</p>
<h3 id="service-business">Service Business</h3>
<p>A service business is one that provides services rather than tangible goods. These businesses focus on fulfilling customer needs through services such as healthcare, education, finance, entertainment, and more. The primary characteristic of a service business is that it delivers intangible products to the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Service businesses provide intangible products (e.g., advice, healthcare, education).</li>
<li>They contribute to the economy by offering specialized skills, knowledge, and expertise.</li>
<li>Service businesses often focus on customer satisfaction and experience.</li>
<li>Examples of service businesses include hospitals, banks, schools, and entertainment providers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="commerce-business">Commerce Business</h3>
<p>Commerce refers to the exchange of goods and services between businesses and consumers. It is the act of buying and selling goods and services in various markets. Commerce involves both trade (buying and selling) and distribution, which ensures that products and services reach consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Commerce involves buying and selling activities.</li>
<li>It connects producers and consumers in the market.</li>

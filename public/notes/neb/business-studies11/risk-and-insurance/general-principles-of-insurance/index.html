         <h1 id="general-principles-of-insurance">General Principles of Insurance</h1>
<p>Insurance is based on a set of fundamental principles that ensure fairness, transparency, and the effective functioning of the system. These principles are designed to balance the interests of both the insurer and the insured. Understanding these principles helps individuals and businesses make informed decisions when purchasing insurance policies.</p>
<h2 id="key-principles-of-insurance"><strong>Key Principles of Insurance</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-utmost-good-faith-uberrimae-fidei">1. <strong>Utmost Good Faith (Uberrimae Fidei)</strong></h3>
<p>This principle requires both the insurer and the insured to disclose all material facts truthfully. The insured must provide accurate information about the risk to be covered, and the insurer must disclose the terms and conditions of the policy in full. Any concealment or misrepresentation can void the insurance contract.</p>
<h3 id="2-insurable-interest">2. <strong>Insurable Interest</strong></h3>
<p>An individual or business can only take out insurance on something in which they have a financial interest. This means the insured must suffer financially in the event of a loss to the subject of the insurance (e.g., property, health, life). This principle ensures that insurance is not used for speculative purposes, but to protect actual financial interests.</p>
<h3 id="3-indemnity">3. <strong>Indemnity</strong></h3>
<p>The principle of indemnity ensures that the insured is compensated for the actual loss suffered, but not to a greater amount than the loss incurred. This means the insured cannot make a profit from an insurance claim; the purpose is only to restore the insured to the financial position they were in before the loss occurred. This principle applies primarily to property and casualty insurance.</p>
<h3 id="4-subrogation">4. <strong>Subrogation</strong></h3>
<p>Subrogation allows an insurer to assume the rights of the insured to recover the amount of the claim from a third party responsible for the loss. After compensating the insured, the insurer can pursue legal action to recover the cost from the party at fault. This prevents the insured from being paid twice for the same loss.</p>
<h3 id="5-contribution">5. <strong>Contribution</strong></h3>
<p>If an individual or business has more than one insurance policy covering the same risk, the contribution principle comes into play. In case of a claim, each insurer will contribute to the compensation in proportion to the amount of coverage provided. This ensures that the insured does not receive more than the actual loss.</p>
<h3 id="6-loss-minimization">6. <strong>Loss Minimization</strong></h3>
<p>The insured is obligated to take reasonable steps to minimize the loss or damage in the event of an incident. For example, in the case of a fire, the insured should try to put it out or prevent further damage if possible. Failure to mitigate the loss could result in a reduced payout or denial of the claim.</p>
<h3 id="7-causa-proxima-proximate-cause">7. <strong>Causa Proxima (Proximate Cause)</strong></h3>
<p>The proximate cause principle dictates that an insurer is liable for losses caused by a peril that is directly covered under the policy. It requires that the cause of the loss be the nearest or most immediate cause, not a distant or indirect one. For example, if a flood causes damage but is preceded by another uninsurable event, the insurer may not be liable.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The general principles of insurance form the foundation for a fair and transparent relationship between the insurer and the insured. These principles include utmost good faith, insurable interest, indemnity, subrogation, contribution, loss minimization, and proximate cause. They ensure that insurance provides genuine financial protection and prevents misuse or abuse of the system. Understanding these principles is essential for anyone entering into an insurance contract, as they define the rights and responsibilities of both parties.</p>

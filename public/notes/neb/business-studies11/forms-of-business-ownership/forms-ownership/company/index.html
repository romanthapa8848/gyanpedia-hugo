         <h1 id="company">Company</h1>
<p>A <strong>company</strong> is a legal entity that is distinct from its owners, created for the purpose of carrying out business activities. It is a separate entity that can own property, incur debts, and be sued in its name. In Nepal, companies are primarily governed by the <strong>Companies Act, 2006</strong>, which defines their types, formation process, and operational structure. Companies are usually formed for profit-making purposes, and their ownership is divided into shares held by shareholders.</p>
<h2 id="features-of-a-company">Features of a Company</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Separate Legal Entity</strong>: A company is recognized as a separate legal entity from its shareholders and directors. It can own assets, enter into contracts, and be liable for its own debts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Liability</strong>: Shareholders&rsquo; liability is limited to the amount unpaid on their shares. This means their personal assets are protected if the company fails.</p>

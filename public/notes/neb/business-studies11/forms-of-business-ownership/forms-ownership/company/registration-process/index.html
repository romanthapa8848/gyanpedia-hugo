<p>Starting a business in Nepal requires going through a formal registration process. The <strong>Company Registration</strong> process involves legal procedures that ensure a business is recognized by the government and complies with the <strong>Companies Act, 2006</strong> of Nepal. The following outlines the step-by-step process for registering a company in Nepal.</p>
<h2 id="1-choose-a-company-name">1. <strong>Choose a Company Name</strong></h2>
<p>Before beginning the registration process, the first step is to select a suitable name for the company. The name should reflect the nature of the business and must be unique. It should not be similar to any existing company or trade name.</p>
<h3 id="requirements-for-the-company-name">Requirements for the Company Name:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The name must be in compliance with the <strong>Company Registration Act</strong>.</li>
<li>It must not violate trademarks or other intellectual property laws.</li>
<li>The name should be easy to remember and not misleading.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-prepare-required-documents">2. <strong>Prepare Required Documents</strong></h2>
<p>The next step is to gather the necessary documents that are required for company registration. The following documents are typically needed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company’s Memorandum of Association (MoA)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Company’s Articles of Association (AoA)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Proof of identity and address of directors</strong> (e.g., passport copy or citizenship card)</li>

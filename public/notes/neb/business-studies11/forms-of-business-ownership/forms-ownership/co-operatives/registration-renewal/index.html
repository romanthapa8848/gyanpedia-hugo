<p>Co-operatives in Nepal play an essential role in various sectors, including agriculture, consumer goods, finance, and services. The government has established procedures for registering and renewing co-operatives, ensuring they function legally and efficiently. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to register and renew co-operatives in Nepal.</p>
<h2 id="procedure-of-registration-of-co-operatives-in-nepal"><strong>Procedure of Registration of Co-operatives in Nepal</strong></h2>
<p>The registration of co-operatives in Nepal is managed by the <strong>Department of Co-operatives (DoC)</strong> under the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development. The process involves the following steps:</p>
<h3 id="step-1-formation-of-a-co-operative-society"><strong>Step 1: Formation of a Co-operative Society</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The first step is for individuals interested in forming a co-operative to come together and prepare a <strong>preliminary meeting</strong> to discuss the purpose, scope, and structure of the co-operative.</li>
<li>A <strong>minimum of 15 members</strong> is required to establish a co-operative society.</li>
<li>Members should agree on the <strong>objectives</strong>, <strong>membership criteria</strong>, and <strong>business activities</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-prepare-the-required-documents"><strong>Step 2: Prepare the Required Documents</strong></h3>
<p>To apply for registration, the following documents are required:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Application form</strong> – available from the Department of Co-operatives or local offices.</li>
<li><strong>Draft of the Co-operative&rsquo;s bylaws</strong> – including the purpose, terms of membership, and operating guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>Minutes of the first meeting</strong> – showing agreement among the members to form the co-operative.</li>
<li><strong>List of founding members</strong> – including names, addresses, and signatures.</li>
<li><strong>National ID cards</strong> or <strong>citizenship certificates</strong> of all founding members.</li>
<li><strong>Passport-sized photographs</strong> of all members.</li>

<h3 id="step-3-submit-application-to-the-department-of-co-operatives"><strong>Step 3: Submit Application to the Department of Co-operatives</strong></h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-inspection-and-approval"><strong>Step 4: Inspection and Approval</strong></h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="step-5-issue-of-registration-certificate"><strong>Step 5: Issue of Registration Certificate</strong></h3>

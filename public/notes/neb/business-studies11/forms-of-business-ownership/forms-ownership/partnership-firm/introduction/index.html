         <h1 id="introduction-to-partnership-firm">Introduction to Partnership Firm</h1>
<p>A <strong>partnership firm</strong> is a business structure where two or more individuals or entities join forces to conduct business for mutual benefit. Each partner contributes to the business, whether in capital, labor, or expertise, and shares the profits and losses generated by the business. A key feature of a partnership is the <strong>partnership agreement</strong>, which sets forth the terms of operation, profit distribution, and the roles and responsibilities of each partner.</p>
<p>In Nepal, partnerships are governed by the <strong>Partnership Act of 1964</strong>, which establishes the legal framework for their formation and regulation. This form of business organization is popular among small to medium-sized enterprises due to its <strong>ease of establishment</strong> and <strong>cost-effectiveness</strong> compared to other structures like corporations.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-a-partnership-firm">Key Features of a Partnership Firm:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mutual Agreement</strong>: The terms of the partnership are outlined in a formal agreement, which helps prevent conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Profits and Losses</strong>: Partners share the financial outcomes of the business, including profits and losses, based on their agreed-upon ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Unlimited Liability</strong>: In a general partnership, partners have unlimited liability, meaning their personal assets can be used to settle business debts.</li>
<li><strong>Collective Decision-Making</strong>: Partners are involved in the management and decision-making of the business, according to the partnership agreement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-partnership-firms">Types of Partnership Firms:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>General Partnership</strong>: All partners share management responsibilities and are equally liable for the business’s debts.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Partnership</strong>: Includes both general partners (who manage the business) and limited partners (who contribute capital but have limited liability).</li>
<li><strong>Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</strong>: Partners have limited liability for the business&rsquo;s debts, combining features of both partnerships and corporations.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the partnership firm does not have a separate legal identity from its partners, it is a widely recognized and legally sound business structure that provides flexibility in business operations. This makes it an attractive choice for entrepreneurs seeking a simple, yet effective, way to collaborate and grow a business.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

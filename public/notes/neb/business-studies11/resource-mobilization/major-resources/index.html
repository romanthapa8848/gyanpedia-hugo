<p>For any business to function effectively, it needs to mobilize and manage various types of resources. These resources are essential to ensure smooth operations, achieve business goals, and sustain growth. The major resources that businesses require are classified into four categories: financial, physical, human, and informational. Each type plays a distinct but interconnected role in business success.</p>
<h3 id="1-financial-resources">1. <strong>Financial Resources</strong></h3>
<p>Financial resources refer to the funds required by a business to carry out its operations and achieve its objectives. These resources can be obtained from various sources, such as investors, loans, and retained earnings. Key aspects of financial resources include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital investment</strong>: Money needed for initial setup, expansion, and growth.</li>
<li><strong>Operational funding</strong>: Ongoing expenses for day-to-day operations like salaries, rent, and utilities.</li>
<li><strong>Financial management</strong>: Ensuring the efficient allocation and use of funds to maximize profitability and sustain operations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-physical-resources">2. <strong>Physical Resources</strong></h3>

<h3 id="3-human-resources">3. <strong>Human Resources</strong></h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="4-informational-resources">4. <strong>Informational Resources</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market data</strong>: Information on consumer preferences, trends, and competitor activities.</li>

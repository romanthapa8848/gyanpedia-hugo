         <h1 id="finance-company">Finance Company</h1>
<p>A <strong>finance company</strong> is a specialized financial institution that primarily deals with providing medium-term and long-term financing to individuals, small businesses, and corporate clients. Unlike commercial banks, which offer a broad range of banking services, finance companies are focused on lending, investment, and providing credit to meet the specific financial needs of borrowers.</p>
<p>In Nepal, finance companies are regulated by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), which ensures that they maintain proper capital and operational standards to avoid financial instability. These companies play a significant role in filling the gap left by commercial banks by offering more flexible financing options for sectors that may not be eligible for traditional bank loans.</p>

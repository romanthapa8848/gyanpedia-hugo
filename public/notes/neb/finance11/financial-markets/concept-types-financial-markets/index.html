<p><strong>Financial markets</strong> are platforms or systems where buyers and sellers trade financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, currencies, and other assets. These markets play a crucial role in the economy by enabling the flow of funds between investors and borrowers, facilitating the creation of liquidity, and helping in price discovery.</p>

Within these, there are further subcategories like the <strong>primary market</strong>, <strong>secondary market</strong>, and others.</p>

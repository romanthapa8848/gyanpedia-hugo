<p><strong>Mutual funds</strong> are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments, or other assets. These funds are managed by professional fund managers who aim to achieve the fund&rsquo;s investment objectives.</p>
<p>Investors in a mutual fund purchase units or shares of the fund, which represent their proportionate ownership in the fund&rsquo;s assets. Mutual funds provide an opportunity for individuals to invest in financial markets with minimal effort and expertise, making them a popular choice for retail investors.</p>

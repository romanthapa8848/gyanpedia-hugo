<p>The <strong>Polygon Law of Vectors</strong> is another method for adding vectors graphically. It states that if multiple vectors are represented by the sides of a polygon, taken in order, then the resultant vector is represented by the diagonal drawn from the initial point to the final point of the polygon.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="statement">Statement</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If a number of vectors are represented in magnitude and direction by the sides of a polygon taken in order, then the resultant vector is represented by the diagonal of the polygon drawn from the initial point to the final point.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="representation">Representation</h2>
<p>Consider multiple vectors <strong>$\vec{A_1}$</strong>, <strong>$\vec{A_2}$</strong>, &hellip;, <strong>$\vec{A_n}$</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Represent the vectors <strong>$\vec{A_1}$</strong>, <strong>$\vec{A_2}$</strong>, &hellip;, <strong>$\vec{A_n}$</strong> as directed line segments starting from a common point.</li>
<li>The vectors should be drawn in a sequential order, one after the other.</li>
<li>The resultant vector <strong>$\vec{R}$</strong> is represented by the diagonal drawn from the initial point to the final point of the polygon.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mathematical-representation">Mathematical Representation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The resultant vector can be calculated by vector addition:
$$
  \vec{R} = \vec{A_1} + \vec{A_2} + \cdots + \vec{A_n}
  $$<br>
where each vector is represented by its magnitude and direction.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="proof-polygon-law-of-vector-addition">Proof: Polygon Law of Vector Addition</h2>
<p>The <strong>Polygon Law of Vector Addition</strong> states that if the sides of a polygon represent multiple vectors in magnitude and direction, then the resultant vector is represented by the diagonal drawn from the initial point to the final point of the polygon.</p>
<h3 id="derivation">Derivation:</h3>
<p>Consider a polygon with vectors <strong>$\vec{A}$</strong>, <strong>$\vec{B}$</strong>, <strong>$\vec{C}$</strong>, and <strong>$\vec{D}$</strong>. These vectors represent the sides of the polygon taken in the same order. The resultant vector <strong>$\vec{R}$</strong> can be expressed as:</p>
$$
\vec{R} = \vec{A} + \vec{B} + \vec{C} + \vec{D}
$$<p>Now, consider a polygon of 5 sides. By applying the <strong>Triangle Law of Vector Addition</strong> to each successive pair of vectors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In triangle <strong>ABC</strong>, by the triangle law, we have:
</p>
$$
   \vec{AB} + \vec{BC} = \vec{AC} \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   $$</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly:
</p>
$$
   \vec{AC} + \vec{CD} = \vec{AD} \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   $$</li>
<li>
<p>And:
</p>
$$
   \vec{AD} + \vec{DE} = \vec{AE} \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
   $$</li>
</ol>
<p>By adding Equations 1, 2, and 3, we get:
</p>
$$
\vec{AB} + \vec{BC} + \vec{CD} + \vec{DE} = \vec{AE}
$$<p>Here, <strong>$\vec{AE}$</strong> is the resultant vector, and the other terms are the individual vectors. This can be extended for an <strong>n-sided polygon</strong> using similar steps.</p>
<p>Thus, the <strong>Polygon Law of Vector Addition</strong> allows the addition of vectors in a polygonal shape, where the diagonal from the initial to the final point gives the resultant vector.</p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>1. What is the Polygon Law of Vectors?</strong><br>
The Polygon Law of Vectors states that if vectors are represented by the sides of a polygon, the diagonal drawn from the initial point to the final point gives the resultant vector.</p>
<p><strong>2. How is the resultant vector determined using the Polygon Law?</strong><br>
The resultant vector is represented by the diagonal of the polygon formed by joining the vectors in sequence.</p>
<p><strong>3. Can the Polygon Law be used for two vectors?</strong><br>
Yes, it is just another graphical method for adding vectors, similar to the Parallelogram Law.</p>
<p><strong>4. Can the Polygon Law be applied to more than two vectors?</strong><br>
Yes, the Polygon Law is particularly useful for adding multiple vectors at once.</p>
<p><strong>5. How does the Polygon Law differ from the Parallelogram Law?</strong><br>
The Parallelogram Law is used for two vectors, while the Polygon Law can be used to add multiple vectors.</p>
<p><strong>6. What happens when the vectors form a closed polygon?</strong><br>
If the vectors form a closed polygon (i.e., the initial and final points coincide), the resultant vector is zero.</p>
<p><strong>7. Can the Polygon Law be used to subtract vectors?</strong><br>
Yes, vector subtraction can be done by reversing the direction of one vector and then applying the Polygon Law.</p>
<p><strong>8. How does the angle between vectors affect the resultant?</strong><br>
The angle between the vectors determines the direction and magnitude of the resultant vector.</p>
<p><strong>9. What is the significance of the order in which the vectors are added?</strong><br>
The order in which the vectors are connected affects the direction of the resultant but not its magnitude.</p>
<p><strong>10. What is the main use of the Polygon Law in physics?</strong><br>
It is mainly used to determine the resultant of multiple forces or velocities acting at different angles.</p>

<h2 id="meaning-of-labeling">Meaning of Labeling</h2>
<p>Labeling refers to the process of attaching a label to a product, which provides essential information about the product to consumers. A label typically includes the name, brand, price, ingredients, instructions, and other important details that help consumers understand the product. It serves as a form of communication between the manufacturer and the consumer.</p>
<p>A label is often a printed tag, sticker, or seal that is affixed to a product or its packaging, offering information on the product&rsquo;s quality, quantity, and usage. It plays a critical role in making the product identifiable and influencing consumer decision-making.</p>

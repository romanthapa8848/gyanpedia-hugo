<p><strong>Honesty in Advertising</strong>: Advertising should be truthful, not misleading, and should accurately represent the product or service. False claims or exaggerations can lead to consumer distrust and legal consequences.</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding Misleading Claims</strong>: Marketers should avoid exaggerating the benefits or features of their products. Claims should be substantiated with facts, and companies should avoid making promises that cannot be kept.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adhering to Legal Standards</strong>: Ethical guidelines in marketing are closely aligned with legal standards. Marketers should follow all relevant laws and regulations, including those related to advertising, consumer protection, and competition.</p>

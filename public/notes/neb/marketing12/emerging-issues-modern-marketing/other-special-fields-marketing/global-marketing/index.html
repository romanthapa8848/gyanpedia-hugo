<p>Global marketing is the process of planning, creating, placing, and promoting products or services in the global marketplace. It is about recognizing the diversity of consumers across various countries and regions and adjusting marketing strategies to fit local tastes and demands while maintaining a consistent brand identity across global markets. Global marketing involves activities such as market research, product adaptation, pricing, and distribution, aimed at maximizing the success of a company’s products in multiple international markets.</p>
<h3 id="meaning-of-global-marketing">Meaning of Global Marketing</h3>
<p>Global marketing refers to the process of designing, promoting, pricing, and distributing a product or service across international borders. This strategy is designed to make the brand or product appeal to consumers in different countries while considering local preferences, regulations, and economic conditions.

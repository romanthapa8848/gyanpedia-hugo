<p>Scientific inquiry in psychology follows a systematic process to ensure that conclusions are reliable and valid. The four key steps in scientific inquiry are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Problem Identification</strong>: The first step is recognizing and clearly defining a research problem or question. This involves observing phenomena, reviewing existing literature, and identifying gaps or areas where further understanding is needed. Proper problem identification is crucial because it sets the foundation for the entire research process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hypothesis Formulation</strong>: Once the problem is identified, researchers develop a hypothesis, which is a testable prediction about the relationship between variables. A good hypothesis is specific, measurable, and based on existing theories or observations. It serves as a tentative explanation for the problem identified in the first step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hypothesis Testing</strong>: In this step, researchers design and conduct experiments or collect data to test the hypothesis. This phase involves careful data collection, observation, and analysis using appropriate scientific methods. Hypothesis testing helps determine whether the hypothesis holds true or needs to be revised or rejected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verification</strong>: After testing the hypothesis, the results are verified to confirm their accuracy and reliability. This step often involves replication, where other researchers attempt to reproduce the results to ensure that the findings are not due to chance or specific conditions. Verification also involves peer review to ensure the research meets scientific standards.</p>
</li>
</ul>

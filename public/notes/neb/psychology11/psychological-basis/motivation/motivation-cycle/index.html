<p>Motivation refers to the internal process that initiates, directs, and sustains goal-directed behavior. It acts as a driving force that influences individuals to achieve their goals and fulfill their needs. Motivation can stem from both internal (intrinsic) and external (extrinsic) factors.</p>

<h2 id="the-motivation-cycle">The Motivation Cycle</h2>
<p>The motivation cycle explains how motivation operates in a continuous process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Need</strong>: An unmet requirement creates a state of imbalance (e.g., hunger).</li>
<li><strong>Drive</strong>: The need generates a drive, which is the internal push to act (e.g., craving food).</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: The individual takes steps to fulfill the need (e.g., eating).</li>
<li><strong>Goal Fulfillment</strong>: Once the need is satisfied, balance is restored (e.g., no longer hungry).</li>
<li><strong>Feedback</strong>: The cycle repeats when a new need arises.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

There are two main types of motivation: primary, which is biologically driven, and secondary, which arises from learned experiences. The motivation cycle illustrates how needs are identified and fulfilled through a continuous process.</p>

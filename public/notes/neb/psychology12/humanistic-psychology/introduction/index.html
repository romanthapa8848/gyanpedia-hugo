</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overemphasis on Individualism</strong>:<br>
Humanistic psychology’s focus on personal growth and self-actualization may neglect the role of social, economic, and cultural factors in shaping behavior.</p>

Some critics argue that terms like self-actualization and personal growth are vague and not well-defined, making it challenging to apply these concepts in practical settings.</p>

Humanistic psychology has been criticized for being overly focused on Western ideals of individualism and personal achievement, which may not be applicable in collectivist societies.</p>

<p><strong>Limited Focus on Negative Aspects</strong>:<br>
While humanistic psychology emphasizes positive human qualities, it may overlook negative aspects such as destructive behaviors or mental health issues, which may need more attention.</p>

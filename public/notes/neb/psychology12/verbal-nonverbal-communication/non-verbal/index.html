<p>The <strong>SOLER</strong> model is a framework used in non-verbal communication, especially in counseling, to help establish rapport and create an open, supportive environment. It stands for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>S</strong>itting Position</li>
<li><strong>O</strong>pen Posture</li>
<li><strong>L</strong>eaning Forward</li>
<li><strong>E</strong>ye Contact</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>elaxed posture</li>
</ul>
<p>These elements help improve communication between the counselor and client by using body language effectively.</p>
<h3 id="1-sitting-position">1. Sitting Position</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Face the client</strong>: Ensure that your body is oriented towards the client to show full attention and respect.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate distance</strong>: Keep a reasonable distance that respects the client’s personal space but is close enough to create connection.</li>
<li><strong>Comfortable but engaged</strong>: Sit comfortably without slouching, indicating that you are open and present in the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid barriers</strong>: Don’t sit behind a desk or any physical barrier that can create a sense of distance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-open-posture">2. Open Posture</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncrossed arms and legs</strong>: This shows you are open, receptive, and ready to engage with the other person.</li>
<li><strong>Body aligned toward the speaker</strong>: Make sure your torso faces the person you are communicating with to show attentiveness.</li>
<li><strong>No defensive gestures</strong>: Avoid crossing arms or legs, which can be interpreted as a sign of defensiveness or discomfort.</li>
<li><strong>Relaxed arms</strong>: Keep your arms at your sides or on the table, signaling that you are engaged but not overbearing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-leaning-forward">3. Leaning Forward</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indicates active listening</strong>: Leaning forward slightly shows that you are focused and engaged in what the other person is saying.</li>
<li><strong>Sign of empathy and interest</strong>: It signals that you care about the conversation and are emotionally present.</li>
<li><strong>Non-intrusive</strong>: Leaning forward should be moderate—not too close as to invade personal space, but enough to show attentiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Helps build rapport</strong>: It creates a sense of connection, making the other person feel heard and valued.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-eye-contact">4. Eye Contact</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shows attentiveness</strong>: Maintaining appropriate eye contact demonstrates that you are actively listening and engaged in the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Builds trust</strong>: Eye contact is essential for establishing trust and rapport, as it signals honesty and openness.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t stare aggressively</strong>: While eye contact is important, it should be natural and comfortable. Avoid staring as it can feel threatening.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural considerations</strong>: Be aware of cultural differences, as the meaning of eye contact may vary across cultures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-relaxed">5. Relaxed</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calm and comfortable demeanor</strong>: A relaxed posture and demeanor make the other person feel at ease and comfortable in the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Open and non-defensive</strong>: Relaxed body language shows you are not guarded and encourages open communication.</li>
<li><strong>Non-verbal reassurance</strong>: A relaxed stance signals that you are approachable, not tense, and ready to communicate in a positive manner.</li>
<li><strong>Self-awareness</strong>: Being mindful of your own body language helps you control nervousness and stay present in the conversation.</li>
</ul>

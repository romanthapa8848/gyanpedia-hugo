<p>In organic chemistry, elimination reactions involve the removal of a group (such as a halogen) from a molecule, resulting in the formation of a double bond. These reactions often lead to the formation of alkenes. Reduction reactions, on the other hand, involve the addition of hydrogen to a molecule, often converting functional groups like carbonyls to alcohols. The Wurtz reaction is a well-known reaction used to synthesize alkanes from alkyl halides.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-elimination-reaction-dehydrohalogenation---saytzeffs-rule">1. <strong>Elimination Reaction (Dehydrohalogenation - Saytzeff&rsquo;s Rule)</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Dehydrohalogenation</strong> is an elimination reaction in which a hydrogen atom and a halogen atom are removed from adjacent carbon atoms, resulting in the formation of an alkene.</p>
<h3 id="saytzeffs-rule">Saytzeff&rsquo;s Rule:</h3>
<p>According to Saytzeff&rsquo;s rule, the more substituted alkene (i.e., the one with more alkyl groups attached to the carbon atoms of the double bond) is the major product of a dehydrohalogenation reaction. This happens because the more substituted alkene is more stable due to hyperconjugation and inductive effects.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example:</h3>
<p>In the reaction of 2-bromo-2-methylpropane with potassium hydroxide ($\ce{KOH}$), the elimination results in the formation of 2-methylpropene as the major product:</p>
$$ \ce{CH3CH(Br)CH3 + KOH → CH2=CHCH3 + KBr + H2O} $$<p>Here, the hydrogen is removed from the carbon adjacent to the carbon bearing the bromine, and the alkene formed is the more substituted product.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-reduction-reactions">2. <strong>Reduction Reactions</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Reduction</strong> refers to the addition of hydrogen atoms or the removal of oxygen atoms from a molecule, generally leading to the formation of more saturated compounds. Common reduction reactions in organic chemistry include:</p>
<h3 id="i-reduction-of-aldehydes-and-ketones-to-alcohols">(i) Reduction of Aldehydes and Ketones to Alcohols:</h3>
<p>Aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to primary and secondary alcohols, respectively, by reagents such as hydrogen gas ($\ce{H2}$) in the presence of a catalyst (e.g., palladium on carbon, $\ce{Pd/C}$).</p>
<h3 id="reaction">Reaction:</h3>
$$ \ce{RCHO + H2 → RCH2OH} \quad \text{(Aldehyde to Primary Alcohol)} $$$$ \ce{R2C=O + H2 → R2CHOH} \quad \text{(Ketone to Secondary Alcohol)} $$<h3 id="ii-reduction-of-nitro-compounds">(ii) Reduction of Nitro Compounds:</h3>
<p>Nitro compounds ($\ce{RNO2}$) can be reduced to amines ($\ce{RNH2}$) by catalytic hydrogenation or using reducing agents like tin ($\ce{Sn}$) with hydrochloric acid ($\ce{HCl}$).</p>
<h3 id="reaction-1">Reaction:</h3>
$$ \ce{RNO2 + 3H2 → RNH2 + 2H2O} $$<hr>
<h2 id="3-wurtz-reaction">3. <strong>Wurtz Reaction</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>Wurtz reaction</strong> is a reaction in which alkyl halides react with sodium metal to form alkanes. This is a classic method for the synthesis of symmetric alkanes. The reaction involves the coupling of two alkyl radicals, which are generated by the reaction of sodium metal with alkyl halides.</p>
<h3 id="example-1">Example:</h3>
<p>When ethyl bromide ($\ce{C2H5Br}$) reacts with sodium metal in dry ether, it undergoes a Wurtz reaction to form <strong>butane</strong> ($\ce{C4H10}$).</p>
<h3 id="reaction-2">Reaction:</h3>
$$ \ce{2C2H5Br + 2Na → C4H10 + 2NaBr} $$<p>This reaction is useful for synthesizing alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms.</p>

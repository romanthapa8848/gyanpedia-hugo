  <div class="math-content"><h1 id="chemical-properties-of-aniline">Chemical Properties of Aniline</h1>
<p>Aniline is an organic compound with the formula $\ce{C6H5NH2}$, consisting of a phenyl group ($\ce{C6H5}$) attached to an amino group ($\ce{NH2}$). It exhibits several chemical properties due to the electron-donating nature of the amino group.</p>
<h2 id="basicity-of-aniline">Basicity of Aniline</h2>
<p>Aniline is a weak base. The nitrogen in the amino group has a lone pair of electrons that can accept a proton, making it basic. However, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen is delocalized into the aromatic ring, which reduces its availability for protonation, making it less basic than aliphatic amines.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-of-basic-nature-of-aniline-with-aliphatic-amines-and-ammonia">Comparison of Basic Nature of Aniline with Aliphatic Amines and Ammonia</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aniline</strong>: The amino group in aniline is less available for protonation due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the benzene ring, making it less basic than aliphatic amines.</li>
<li><strong>Aliphatic Amines</strong>: In aliphatic amines, the amino group is not delocalized into a ring, making the lone pair on nitrogen more available to accept a proton. Therefore, aliphatic amines are more basic than aniline.</li>
<li><strong>Ammonia</strong>: Ammonia is a weaker base compared to aliphatic amines, but its basicity is similar to that of aniline because it does not have the electron-donating effect of the alkyl group.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alkylation">Alkylation</h2>
<p>Alkylation of aniline occurs when an alkyl group ($\ce{R}$) replaces one of the hydrogen atoms on the nitrogen. This reaction leads to the formation of N-alkylated aniline derivatives. The process usually requires a strong electrophile, such as an alkyl halide, and a base to neutralize the produced acid.</p>
<h2 id="acylation">Acylation</h2>
<p>In acylation, aniline reacts with an acyl group ($\ce{RCO}$) to form an amide. The reaction typically occurs in the presence of an acid chloride ($\ce{RCOCl}$) and a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride ($\ce{AlCl3}$). This reaction is used to form aniline derivatives for various applications.</p>
<h2 id="diazotization">Diazotization</h2>
<p>Diazotization is a process in which aniline reacts with nitrous acid ($\ce{HNO2}$) to form a diazonium salt ($\ce{C6H5N2^+}$). The reaction is highly useful in the synthesis of aromatic compounds, especially in the formation of azo dyes.</p>
<h2 id="carbylamine-reaction">Carbylamine Reaction</h2>
<p>The carbylamine reaction involves the reaction of aniline with chloroform ($\ce{CHCl3}$) and a base (usually potassium hydroxide) to form an isocyanide (carbylamine). This reaction is used for the detection of primary amines.</p>
<h2 id="coupling-reaction">Coupling Reaction</h2>
<p>Aniline undergoes coupling reactions, especially with diazonium salts, to form azo compounds. The coupling reaction between aniline and diazonium salts is widely used in the dye industry.</p>
<h2 id="electrophilic-substitution-reactions">Electrophilic Substitution Reactions</h2>
<h3 id="nitration">Nitration</h3>
<p>Aniline undergoes nitration when treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid ($\ce{HNO3}$) and sulfuric acid ($\ce{H2SO4}$). The amino group activates the benzene ring, making it more susceptible to attack by the nitronium ion ($\ce{NO2^+}$), resulting in the formation of nitroaniline.</p>
<h3 id="sulphonation">Sulphonation</h3>
<p>Aniline undergoes sulphonation when treated with fuming sulfuric acid ($\ce{H2SO4}$) or concentrated sulfuric acid. The amino group activates the benzene ring towards electrophilic substitution, and the sulfonic acid group ($\ce{SO3H}$) is introduced at the para position to the amino group.</p>
<h3 id="bromination">Bromination</h3>
<p>Bromination of aniline involves the reaction of aniline with bromine ($\ce{Br2}$), often in the presence of an aqueous medium. The amino group activates the aromatic ring, leading to the substitution of a bromine atom, usually at the para position relative to the amino group.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Aniline is a weak base due to the delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair into the aromatic ring, which makes it less basic than aliphatic amines. It undergoes a variety of reactions including alkylation, acylation, diazotization, and carbylamine formation. It also participates in electrophilic substitution reactions such as nitration, sulphonation, and bromination, leading to the formation of useful derivatives.</p>

<p>Phenol undergoes various reactions with different reagents, each showing unique chemical properties. The reactions with ammonia (NH₃), zinc (Zn), sodium (Na), benzene diazonium chloride, and phthalic anhydride play an essential role in the preparation of various compounds.</p>
<h3 id="1-reaction-with-ammonia-nh">1. <strong>Reaction with Ammonia (NH₃)</strong></h3>
<p>When phenol reacts with ammonia, it undergoes a substitution reaction, forming an amide group. This reaction occurs under basic conditions:
</p>
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + NH_3 \rightarrow C_6H_5NH_2 + H_2O}$$<p>
This reaction forms aniline, which is an important starting material in the preparation of dyes, drugs, and other organic compounds.</p>
<h3 id="2-reaction-with-zinc-zn">2. <strong>Reaction with Zinc (Zn)</strong></h3>
<p>Phenol reacts with zinc metal in the presence of heat to form cyclohexadiene derivatives. This is an example of a reduction reaction:
</p>
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + Zn \rightarrow C_6H_6 + ZnO}$$<p>
In this reaction, phenol is reduced to benzene by zinc, and zinc oxide (\ce{ZnO}) is formed as a byproduct.</p>
<h3 id="3-reaction-with-sodium-na">3. <strong>Reaction with Sodium (Na)</strong></h3>
<p>Phenol reacts with sodium to form sodium phenoxide and hydrogen gas. The reaction proceeds as:
</p>
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + Na \rightarrow C_6H_5ONa + H_2}$$<p>
This reaction is an example of an acid-base reaction, where phenol donates a proton to form the phenoxide ion (\ce{C_6H_5O^-}) and hydrogen gas is released.</p>
<h3 id="4-reaction-with-benzene-diazonium-chloride">4. <strong>Reaction with Benzene Diazonium Chloride</strong></h3>
<p>Phenol undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution with benzene diazonium chloride. The hydroxyl group in phenol is an activating group that increases the reactivity of the aromatic ring:
</p>
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + C_6H_5N_2^+Cl^- \rightarrow C_6H_4(OH)(C_6H_4N_2^+) + HCl}$$<p>
This reaction leads to the formation of azo compounds, which are used in dye synthesis.</p>
<h3 id="5-reaction-with-phthalic-anhydride">5. <strong>Reaction with Phthalic Anhydride</strong></h3>
<p>Phenol reacts with phthalic anhydride to form esters. The reaction proceeds as follows:
</p>
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + (C_6H_4CO)_2O \rightarrow C_6H_4(COOC_6H_5)_2 + H_2O}$$<p>
This esterification reaction produces phenyl phthalate, which is used as a plasticizer in the manufacturing of plastics.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Phenol undergoes various reactions, including substitution, reduction, and esterification, with reagents like ammonia, zinc, sodium, benzene diazonium chloride, and phthalic anhydride. These reactions are important for the synthesis of various organic compounds such as aniline, benzene, azo compounds, and phenyl phthalate.</p>

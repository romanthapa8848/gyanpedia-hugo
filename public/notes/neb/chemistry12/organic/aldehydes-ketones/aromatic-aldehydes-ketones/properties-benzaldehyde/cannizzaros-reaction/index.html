<p>Benzaldehyde ($\ce{C_6H_5CHO}$) is an aromatic aldehyde that, when treated with a strong base, undergoes the Cannizzaro reaction. This reaction is a redox disproportionation in which one molecule of benzaldehyde is reduced to benzyl alcohol ($\ce{C_6H_5CH_2OH}$), while the other molecule is oxidized to form sodium benzoate ($\ce{C_6H_5COONa}$).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="mechanism-of-cannizzaros-reaction-with-benzaldehyde">Mechanism of Cannizzaro&rsquo;s Reaction with Benzaldehyde</h2>
<p>In the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydroxide ($\ce{NaOH}$), the Cannizzaro reaction occurs as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Deprotonation of Benzaldehyde:</strong> The base deprotonates the aldehyde to form the alkoxide ion ($\ce{C_6H_5CH_2O^-}$).</li>
<li><strong>Disproportionation:</strong> The alkoxide ion donates a hydride ion ($\ce{H^-}$) to another molecule of benzaldehyde. One molecule is reduced to benzyl alcohol, and the other is oxidized to the carboxylate ion ($\ce{C_6H_5COO^-}$).</li>
<li><strong>Formation of Products:</strong> The products of the reaction are benzyl alcohol ($\ce{C_6H_5CH_2OH}$) and sodium benzoate ($\ce{C_6H_5COONa}$).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="general-reaction">General Reaction:</h3>
$$ \ce{2C_6H_5CHO + NaOH \rightarrow C_6H_5CH_2OH + C_6H_5COONa} $$<p>This reaction is a classic example of the Cannizzaro reaction in aromatic aldehydes.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="example-with-benzaldehyde">Example with Benzaldehyde</h2>
<p>When benzaldehyde is treated with sodium hydroxide, the reaction can be represented as:</p>
$$ \ce{2C_6H_5CHO + NaOH \rightarrow C_6H_5CH_2OH + C_6H_5COONa} $$<p>Here, one molecule of benzaldehyde is reduced to benzyl alcohol, while the other is oxidized to sodium benzoate.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="properties-of-benzaldehyde-in-the-cannizzaro-reaction">Properties of Benzaldehyde in the Cannizzaro Reaction</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical State:</strong> Benzaldehyde is a colorless or pale yellow liquid with a characteristic almond-like odor.</li>
<li><strong>Solubility:</strong> It is slightly soluble in water but highly soluble in organic solvents such as alcohol and ether.</li>
<li><strong>Reaction with Strong Bases:</strong> When exposed to strong bases like sodium hydroxide, benzaldehyde undergoes the Cannizzaro reaction, resulting in the formation of benzyl alcohol and sodium benzoate.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Benzaldehyde, when treated with a strong base like $\ce{NaOH}$, undergoes the Cannizzaro reaction, a disproportionation process where one molecule is reduced to an alcohol (benzyl alcohol) and the other is oxidized to a carboxylate salt (sodium benzoate). This reaction highlights the unique behavior of benzaldehyde in the presence of strong bases.</p>

<p>Copper is one of the most widely used metals due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, resistance to corrosion, and malleability. It reacts with various substances, and its compounds have various applications. This topic covers the properties of copper, its reactions with air, acids, aqueous ammonia, and metal ions, as well as its diverse uses.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="properties-of-copper">Properties of Copper</h2>
<h3 id="1-reaction-with-air">1. <strong>Reaction with Air</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When copper is heated in the presence of oxygen, it forms copper(II) oxide ($\ce{CuO}$), a black solid:
</p>
$$ \ce{2Cu + O_2 -> 2CuO} $$<ul>
<li>When copper(II) oxide is further heated in the presence of excess oxygen, it forms copper(II) sulfate ($\ce{CuSO_4}$):
$$ \ce{2CuO + O_2 -> 2CuSO_4} $$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In moist air, copper reacts slowly with oxygen and carbon dioxide to form a greenish patina known as <strong>copper carbonate</strong> ($\ce{CuCO_3.Cu(OH)_2}$), which protects the metal from further corrosion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-reaction-with-acids">2. <strong>Reaction with Acids</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reaction with Sulfuric Acid</strong>: Copper reacts with hot concentrated sulfuric acid ($\ce{H_2SO_4}$) to form copper(II) sulfate ($\ce{CuSO_4}$), sulfur dioxide ($\ce{SO_2}$), and water:
</p>
$$ \ce{Cu + 2H_2SO_4 -> CuSO_4 + SO_2 + 2H_2O} $$</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reaction with Nitric Acid</strong>: Copper reacts with concentrated nitric acid ($\ce{HNO_3}$) to form copper(II) nitrate ($\ce{Cu(NO_3)_2}$), nitrogen dioxide ($\ce{NO_2}$), and water:
</p>
$$ \ce{Cu + 4HNO_3 -> Cu(NO_3)_2 + 2H_2O + 2NO_2} $$</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reaction with Dilute Acids</strong>: Copper does not react with dilute acids like hydrochloric acid ($\ce{HCl}$) at room temperature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-reaction-with-aqueous-ammonia">3. <strong>Reaction with Aqueous Ammonia</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Copper(II) ions ($\ce{Cu^{2+}}$) react with aqueous ammonia ($\ce{NH_3}$) to form a deep blue complex:
$$ \ce{[Cu^{2+}] + 4NH_3 -> [Cu(NH_3)_4]^{2+}} $$
<ul>
<li>This reaction is used in the identification of copper(II) ions in qualitative analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-reaction-with-metal-ions">4. <strong>Reaction with Metal Ions</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reaction with Iron</strong>: Copper ions can displace iron from its salts due to the more noble nature of copper:
$$ \ce{CuSO_4 + Fe -> Cu + FeSO_4} $$
<ul>
<li>Copper is less reactive than iron, so this reaction is a demonstration of the reactivity series.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

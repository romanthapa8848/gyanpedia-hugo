         <h1 id="addition-and-condensation-polymers">Addition and Condensation Polymers</h1>
<p>Polymers are large molecules made up of repeating structural units called monomers. They play a significant role in various industries, from packaging materials to medical devices. Based on the method of polymerization, polymers can be classified into two broad categories: addition polymers and condensation polymers.</p>
<h2 id="addition-polymers">Addition Polymers</h2>
<p>Addition polymers are formed by the addition of monomer units with a double bond or a ring structure. The polymerization process involves the opening of the double bond or ring, allowing monomer molecules to add one by one to form long chains. These polymers do not release any by-products during their formation.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Polyethylene (PE)</strong>: Formed by the polymerization of ethylene (C₂H₄) molecules.</li>
<li><strong>Polystyrene (PS)</strong>: Formed by the polymerization of styrene (C₆H₅CH=CH₂).</li>
<li><strong>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)</strong>: Formed by the polymerization of vinyl chloride (C₂H₃Cl).</li>
</ul>
<p>These addition polymers are commonly used in packaging materials, plastic containers, pipes, and insulation.</p>
<h2 id="condensation-polymers">Condensation Polymers</h2>
<p>Condensation polymers are formed by the polymerization of monomers that contain two or more functional groups, typically with the elimination of small molecules such as water, alcohol, or hydrogen chloride. This type of polymerization results in a reduction in the number of monomer units and leads to the formation of a long chain polymer.</p>
<h3 id="examples-1">Examples:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nylon (Polyamide)</strong>: Formed by the condensation of hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid.</li>
<li><strong>Terylene (Polyester)</strong>: Formed by the condensation of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.</li>
<li><strong>Bakelite</strong>: A thermosetting resin formed by the condensation of phenol and formaldehyde.</li>
</ul>
<p>Condensation polymers are widely used in fibers, textiles, films, and engineering plastics.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Addition and condensation polymers are two major classes of synthetic polymers. Addition polymers are formed by adding monomers with unsaturated bonds, whereas condensation polymers are created by the elimination of small molecules during the polymerization of monomers. Both types of polymers have vast industrial applications, from packaging materials to clothing and engineering plastics.</p>

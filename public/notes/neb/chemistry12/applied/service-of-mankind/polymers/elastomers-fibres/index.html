         <h1 id="elastomers-and-fibres">Elastomers and Fibres</h1>
<p>Elastomers and fibres are two important classes of polymers that play vital roles in modern industries. Elastomers are known for their rubber-like properties, while fibres are long, flexible polymers used primarily for making textiles. Both are created through different polymerization methods and have distinct physical properties that make them suitable for specific applications.</p>
<h2 id="elastomers">Elastomers</h2>
<p>Elastomers are polymers with the ability to stretch significantly and return to their original shape once the stress is removed. This elastic property is a result of the long polymer chains being cross-linked, which allows the material to &ldquo;bounce back&rdquo; when stretched. The most common elastomer is rubber, which can be natural or synthetic.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural Rubber (Polyisoprene)</strong>: Obtained from the sap of the rubber tree, natural rubber has excellent elasticity and is widely used in tires, footwear, and medical devices.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic Rubber</strong>: Made through polymerization of monomers like butadiene and styrene, synthetic rubbers are used in a variety of applications, including tires and gaskets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vulcanization-of-rubber">Vulcanization of Rubber:</h3>
<p>Vulcanization is the process of heating rubber with sulfur to create cross-links between the polymer chains. This process enhances the strength, elasticity, and durability of rubber.</p>
<h2 id="fibres">Fibres</h2>
<p>Fibres are long, thread-like polymers that are spun into threads and woven into fabrics. These can be natural or synthetic, and they are primarily used for textile production, ropes, and other materials that require flexibility and strength.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-fibres">Types of Fibres:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Natural Fibres</strong>: These include cotton, wool, and silk, derived from plants or animals.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic Fibres</strong>: These are man-made fibres produced through polymerization processes. Common synthetic fibres include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Nylon (Polyamide)</strong>: A strong, durable synthetic fibre used in clothing, carpets, and ropes.</li>
<li><strong>Terylene (Polyester)</strong>: A synthetic fibre known for its durability, used in clothing and home furnishings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Elastomers are polymers with excellent stretchability and flexibility, primarily used in rubber products. Fibres, both natural and synthetic, are long polymer chains used in textile production and other applications that require strength and durability. Vulcanization of elastomers enhances their properties, while synthetic fibres like nylon and terylene have revolutionized the textile industry.</p>

<p>The <strong>First Law of Thermodynamics</strong> is a statement of the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another. This law is fundamental to understanding the energy changes that occur during chemical reactions and physical processes.</p>
<h3 id="statement-of-the-first-law">Statement of the First Law:</h3>
<p>The first law of thermodynamics can be stated as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This law is essentially a statement of the <strong>conservation of energy</strong>, indicating that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant. The law also establishes that the change in internal energy of a system is the sum of the heat added to the system and the work done by the system.</p>
<h3 id="mathematical-expression-of-the-first-law">Mathematical Expression of the First Law:</h3>
<p>The first law of thermodynamics is mathematically expressed as:</p>
$$
\Delta U = Q - W
$$<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\Delta U$ is the change in internal energy of the system,</li>
<li>$Q$ is the heat added to the system (positive when heat is added, negative when heat is removed),</li>
<li>$W$ is the work done by the system (positive when the system does work on the surroundings, negative when work is done on the system).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal Energy ($U$)</strong>: The total energy contained within the system, including kinetic and potential energy at the microscopic level (due to the motion and interactions of molecules).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heat ($Q$)</strong>: The form of energy transfer that occurs due to a temperature difference. Heat flows from a higher temperature to a lower temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Work ($W$)</strong>: The energy transferred when a force is applied to move an object. In thermodynamics, work is done when the system expands or contracts against external pressure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="applications-of-the-first-law">Applications of the First Law:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy Conservation</strong>: In any thermodynamic process, the total energy is conserved. If heat is added to the system, some of that energy is used to do work, and the remainder contributes to the system&rsquo;s internal energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heat Engines</strong>: The first law is applied in understanding how heat engines convert thermal energy into mechanical work, ensuring that energy input equals the sum of the work done and the heat lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adiabatic Processes</strong>: In an adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings, so $\Delta U = -W$. This means the change in internal energy is entirely due to the work done by or on the system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="thermodynamic-systems">Thermodynamic Systems:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Systems</strong>: Matter and energy can be exchanged with the surroundings.</li>
<li><strong>Closed Systems</strong>: Only energy can be exchanged with the surroundings, but matter cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Isolated Systems</strong>: Neither matter nor energy can be exchanged with the surroundings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heat-and-work-in-thermodynamic-processes">Heat and Work in Thermodynamic Processes:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isothermal Process</strong>: The temperature of the system remains constant, and thus $\Delta U = 0$, meaning that the heat added to the system is entirely used to do work.</li>
<li><strong>Adiabatic Process</strong>: No heat exchange occurs, and the internal energy changes solely due to work done by or on the system.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.</li>
<li>The change in internal energy of a system is the difference between heat added to the system and the work done by the system.</li>
<li>This law applies to all thermodynamic processes, including heat engines and adiabatic processes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<h3 id="1-what-does-the-first-law-of-thermodynamics-state">1. What does the first law of thermodynamics state?</h3>
<p>The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-is-internal-energy-in-thermodynamics">2. What is internal energy in thermodynamics?</h3>
<p>Internal energy is the total energy contained within a system, including both the microscopic kinetic and potential energy of molecules.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-is-the-relationship-between-heat-and-work">3. What is the relationship between heat and work?</h3>
<p>Heat is the energy transferred due to temperature differences, while work is the energy transferred when a system moves against external pressure.</p>
<h3 id="4-how-is-the-first-law-applied-in-heat-engines">4. How is the first law applied in heat engines?</h3>
<p>In heat engines, the first law dictates that the energy input as heat is partially converted into work, and the remaining energy is released as heat.</p>
<h3 id="5-what-is-an-adiabatic-process">5. What is an adiabatic process?</h3>
<p>An adiabatic process is one in which no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. In this process, the change in internal energy is solely due to the work done by or on the system.</p>
<h3 id="6-what-happens-during-an-isothermal-process">6. What happens during an isothermal process?</h3>
<p>In an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant, and any heat added to the system is entirely used to do work, with no change in internal energy.</p>
<h3 id="7-can-energy-be-destroyed-in-a-thermodynamic-system">7. Can energy be destroyed in a thermodynamic system?</h3>
<p>No, according to the first law, energy cannot be destroyed; it can only be transformed from one form to another.</p>
<h3 id="8-what-is-the-significance-of-the-first-law-in-thermodynamics">8. What is the significance of the first law in thermodynamics?</h3>
<p>The first law is a statement of energy conservation and helps us understand how energy flows in and out of a system during various processes.</p>
<h3 id="9-how-does-the-first-law-apply-to-closed-systems">9. How does the first law apply to closed systems?</h3>
<p>In closed systems, the first law of thermodynamics tells us that any change in internal energy must come from either heat transfer into the system or work done on or by the system.</p>
<h3 id="10-what-is-the-mathematical-expression-for-the-first-law">10. What is the mathematical expression for the first law?</h3>
<p>The mathematical expression for the first law is $\Delta U = Q - W$, where $\Delta U$ is the change in internal energy, $Q$ is heat added, and $W$ is work done by the system.</p>

<p>Scientific Management, developed by Frederick Taylor, is a theory of management that applies scientific methods to improve work efficiency. It emphasizes the systematic study of tasks, optimizing performance, and maximizing productivity.</p>
<h3 id="principles-of-scientific-management">Principles of Scientific Management</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Science, Not Rule of Thumb</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace traditional methods of doing work with scientifically proven techniques.</li>
<li>Decisions should be based on data and facts rather than guesswork.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Harmony, Not Discord</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote cooperation between workers and managers.</li>
<li>Encourage mutual understanding and eliminate conflicts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental Revolution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both workers and managers must change their attitudes toward each other.</li>
<li>Managers should adopt a cooperative approach, and workers should take more responsibility for their work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Division of Work and Responsibility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tasks should be divided between management and workers.</li>
<li>Managers should plan and supervise, while workers focus on execution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scientific Selection and Training</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers should be scientifically selected based on their skills and abilities.</li>
<li>They must be properly trained to perform tasks efficiently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maximum Output, Minimum Effort</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to achieve the highest level of output with the least amount of effort.</li>
<li>Efficiency is key in both physical tasks and managerial processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="limitations-of-scientific-management">Limitations of Scientific Management</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Overemphasis on Efficiency</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on increasing productivity may lead to neglecting the human aspect of work.</li>
<li>Workers may feel like machines, leading to dissatisfaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dehumanization of Workers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The focus on maximizing output can treat workers as mere tools rather than valuable individuals.</li>
<li>Can result in poor morale and reduced job satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ignores Social Factors</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientific management overlooks the social needs and psychological aspects of workers.</li>
<li>It fails to address teamwork, motivation, and worker relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not Suitable for Complex Jobs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It works best for repetitive, manual tasks and may not be effective for complex or creative jobs that require judgment and decision-making.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resistance from Workers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers may resist the strict implementation of scientific management, feeling their autonomy and creativity are being suppressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Flexibility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rigidity of scientific management can reduce flexibility and adaptability in a rapidly changing environment.</li>
<li>It might not work well in organizations that need innovation and change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h3 id="limitations-of-administrative-management">Limitations of Administrative Management</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Overemphasis on Formalization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fayol’s principles emphasize formal rules and procedures, which may lead to rigidity in the organization.</li>
<li>This can stifle creativity and innovation, particularly in dynamic environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Flexibility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The principles can be too rigid, leading to a lack of flexibility and adaptability.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not Focused on Worker Needs</strong>:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>

<p><strong>Limited Applicability in Modern Organizations</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<li>It is less suitable for organizations that value innovation, autonomy, and flexibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Over-Simplification</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fayol’s principles provide a general framework for management but may oversimplify the complexities of modern organizational structures.</li>
<li>It doesn’t fully account for the dynamic and complex nature of modern management environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not Universally Applicable</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The principles were developed in the early 20th century, and they may not be applicable to all types of organizations, especially those in rapidly changing industries or those with different cultural contexts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

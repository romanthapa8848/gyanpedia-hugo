         <h1 id="mendelian-genetics-general-terminology">Mendelian Genetics: General Terminology</h1>
<p>Mendelian genetics, based on the work of Gregor Mendel, forms the foundation of classical genetics. Mendel&rsquo;s experiments on pea plants led to the discovery of fundamental principles of inheritance. Understanding the general terminology used in Mendelian genetics is crucial to grasp inheritance patterns and genetic variations.</p>

<h2 id="key-terminology-in-mendelian-genetics">Key Terminology in Mendelian Genetics</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: A gene is a unit of heredity that is passed from parents to offspring. It carries the instructions for the synthesis of proteins or RNA, influencing traits in an organism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allele</strong>: An allele is a variant form of a gene. For each gene, an organism typically has two alleles—one inherited from each parent. Alleles can be dominant or recessive, depending on how they express traits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dominant Allele</strong>: A dominant allele is an allele that expresses its trait even when only one copy is present (heterozygous condition). For example, in the case of flower color in pea plants, the purple color allele (P) is dominant over the white color allele (p).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recessive Allele</strong>: A recessive allele expresses its trait only when two copies of the allele are present (homozygous condition). For example, the white flower color in pea plants is the result of the recessive allele (p) when inherited in a homozygous state (pp).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Homozygous</strong>: An organism is homozygous for a gene when it has two identical alleles for that gene (e.g., PP or pp). Homozygous individuals can be either dominant or recessive, depending on the allele combination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heterozygous</strong>: An organism is heterozygous for a gene when it has two different alleles for that gene (e.g., Pp). Heterozygous individuals typically express the dominant trait, as the dominant allele masks the recessive allele.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genotype</strong>: The genotype refers to the genetic constitution of an organism, specifically the alleles present for a particular gene. It is the underlying genetic makeup that determines the phenotype. For example, the genotype of a pea plant for flower color might be PP, Pp, or pp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phenotype</strong>: The phenotype is the observable physical or biochemical characteristics of an organism, which result from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. For example, the phenotype of a pea plant may be purple or white flowers, depending on its genotype.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Punnett Square</strong>: A Punnett square is a diagram used to predict the possible genotypes of offspring based on the genotypes of the parents. It is a tool used to visualize the inheritance of alleles in a simple genetic cross.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Law of Segregation</strong>: This law states that each organism has two alleles for each gene, and these alleles separate during gamete formation, with each gamete carrying only one allele for each gene.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Law of Independent Assortment</strong>: This law states that genes located on different chromosomes are inherited independently of each other. This leads to the formation of new combinations of traits in the offspring.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Mendelian genetics is essential for understanding inheritance patterns in organisms. The key terms, such as gene, allele, dominant, recessive, genotype, and phenotype, are the building blocks of this field. By studying these terms, one can predict how traits are inherited from one generation to the next and how genetic diversity arises in populations.</p>

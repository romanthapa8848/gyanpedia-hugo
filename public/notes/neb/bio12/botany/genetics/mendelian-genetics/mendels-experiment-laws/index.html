         <h1 id="mendels-experiment-and-laws-of-inheritance">Mendel&rsquo;s Experiment and Laws of Inheritance</h1>
<p>Gregor Mendel, often called the father of genetics, conducted experiments on pea plants in the 19th century that led to the discovery of the fundamental principles of inheritance. His work laid the foundation for the science of genetics, explaining how traits are inherited from one generation to the next. Mendel&rsquo;s experiments used mathematical analysis to describe inheritance patterns and established key laws of inheritance.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="mendels-experiment">Mendel’s Experiment</h2>
<p>Mendel’s experiments involved pea plants (Pisum sativum) because they had distinct, easily observable traits, such as flower color, seed shape, and plant height. He chose purebred plants for his crosses, ensuring that the plants were homozygous for each trait. This allowed him to track how traits were passed on across generations.</p>
<h3 id="monohybrid-cross">Monohybrid Cross</h3>
<p>A <strong>monohybrid cross</strong> is a cross between two organisms that differ in only one trait. Mendel started by crossing two pea plants that differed in one characteristic (e.g., flower color: purple and white).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P generation</strong> (parental generation): Mendel crossed purebred plants with different traits (e.g., a purple-flowered plant with a white-flowered plant).</li>
<li><strong>F1 generation</strong> (first filial generation): All the offspring exhibited the dominant trait (purple flowers), which led Mendel to conclude that the dominant allele was masking the recessive allele.</li>
<li><strong>F2 generation</strong> (second filial generation): When the F1 plants were crossed, the resulting offspring showed a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive traits (3 purple flowers to 1 white flower), revealing that traits segregate according to specific ratios.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dihybrid-cross">Dihybrid Cross</h3>
<p>A <strong>dihybrid cross</strong> involves two traits, and Mendel used this to test the inheritance of two different characteristics at the same time. For example, he crossed plants differing in both seed color (yellow vs. green) and seed shape (round vs. wrinkled).</p>
<ul>
<li>The F1 generation showed that both traits were inherited together, but when crossed in the F2 generation, the traits segregated independently of each other, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio of yellow round, yellow wrinkled, green round, and green wrinkled seeds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mendels-laws-of-inheritance">Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance</h2>
<p>Mendel formulated three fundamental laws of inheritance based on his experiments:</p>
<h3 id="1-law-of-segregation">1. <strong>Law of Segregation</strong></h3>
<p>This law states that each organism carries two alleles for each gene, and these alleles segregate during gamete formation. As a result, each gamete (egg or sperm) carries only one allele for each gene. When fertilization occurs, the offspring inherit one allele from each parent.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a monohybrid cross, the F1 generation plants (heterozygous for the trait) produce gametes that carry either the dominant allele (A) or the recessive allele (a), which segregate randomly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-law-of-independent-assortment">2. <strong>Law of Independent Assortment</strong></h3>
<p>This law states that genes located on different chromosomes are inherited independently of one another. This means that the inheritance of one trait does not affect the inheritance of another trait, leading to the formation of new combinations of traits in the offspring.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a dihybrid cross, the inheritance of seed color (yellow or green) is independent of the inheritance of seed shape (round or wrinkled), producing a variety of trait combinations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-law-of-dominance">3. <strong>Law of Dominance</strong></h3>
<p>The law of dominance states that when two different alleles for a gene are present in a heterozygous organism, the dominant allele will be expressed, and the recessive allele will be masked.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a monohybrid cross for flower color, the purple color allele (P) is dominant, while the white color allele (p) is recessive. A plant with a genotype of Pp will have purple flowers because the dominant allele (P) masks the recessive allele (p).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Mendel&rsquo;s experiments with pea plants revealed key laws of inheritance that explained how traits are passed from parents to offspring. His work introduced the concepts of dominant and recessive alleles, the segregation of alleles, and the independent assortment of genes. These laws laid the foundation for modern genetics, providing a framework for understanding heredity in all organisms.</p>

<h3 id="1-what-is-mendels-law-of-segregation">1. What is Mendel’s law of segregation?</h3>
<p>Mendel’s law of segregation states that during gamete formation, alleles for a gene separate, so each gamete carries only one allele for each gene.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-is-a-monohybrid-cross">2. What is a monohybrid cross?</h3>
<p>A monohybrid cross is a cross between two organisms that differ in a single characteristic, such as flower color or seed shape.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-is-the-law-of-independent-assortment">3. What is the law of independent assortment?</h3>
<p>The law of independent assortment states that genes located on different chromosomes are inherited independently, leading to new combinations of traits.</p>
<h3 id="4-what-is-the-difference-between-a-dominant-and-a-recessive-allele">4. What is the difference between a dominant and a recessive allele?</h3>
<p>A dominant allele is expressed in a heterozygous organism, while a recessive allele is expressed only when two copies of the recessive allele are present in a homozygous organism.</p>
<h3 id="5-what-is-a-dihybrid-cross">5. What is a dihybrid cross?</h3>
<p>A dihybrid cross is a cross between two organisms that differ in two characteristics, such as seed color and seed shape.</p>

<h3 id="8-what-is-the-law-of-dominance">8. What is the law of dominance?</h3>

         <h1 id="biotechnology-introduction">Biotechnology: Introduction</h1>
<p>Biotechnology is a broad field that involves the use of living organisms, cells, or their components to develop or create products for a wide range of applications. It combines biological science with technology to bring about advances that have significantly impacted various industries, including agriculture, healthcare, and environmental conservation. Biotechnology aims to use biological systems for practical and commercial applications, such as the production of medicines, food, biofuels, and much more.</p>
<p>The history of biotechnology can be traced back to ancient practices, such as fermentation used in making bread, wine, and beer. However, modern biotechnology uses advanced genetic engineering techniques, including recombinant DNA technology, to modify organisms at the molecular level. This has opened up new possibilities for improving human health, food production, and environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>Food safety and food security are two critical aspects of global health and development. They are closely related but distinct concepts.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="food-safety">Food Safety:</h3>
<p>Food safety refers to the measures taken to ensure that food is free from contaminants such as bacteria, viruses, or harmful chemicals. It focuses on food handling, preparation, and storage processes that prevent foodborne illnesses. Food safety involves monitoring food products throughout the entire food chain, from farm to table.</p>
<p><strong>Key Factors for Ensuring Food Safety:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hygiene</strong>: Proper cleaning and sanitation practices in food processing and handling.</li>
<li><strong>Temperature Control</strong>: Keeping food at safe temperatures during storage and cooking.</li>
<li><strong>Contaminant Control</strong>: Preventing contamination by pathogens, chemicals, or other harmful substances.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="food-security">Food Security:</h3>
<p>Food security means ensuring that all people, at all times, have access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life. It involves not only food availability but also economic access, social stability, and the sustainability of food systems.</p>
<p><strong>Key Components of Food Security:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Food Availability</strong>: Adequate quantities of food available on a consistent basis.</li>
<li><strong>Food Access</strong>: The ability of individuals to obtain food through adequate income or resources.</li>
<li><strong>Food Utilization</strong>: Proper diet, clean water, and adequate nutrition to ensure healthy consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: Consistent food supply, free from fluctuations due to climate change, conflicts, or economic factors.</li>
</ol>

         <h1 id="cardiac-cycle">Cardiac Cycle</h1>
<p>The <strong>cardiac cycle</strong> refers to the sequence of events that occur during one complete heartbeat, including the contraction (systole) and relaxation (diastole) of the heart. The cycle ensures the continuous flow of blood throughout the body and consists of several phases that coordinate the filling and pumping of blood into the heart chambers and out to the body.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="phases-of-the-cardiac-cycle">Phases of the Cardiac Cycle</h2>
<p>The cardiac cycle is divided into two main phases: <strong>Systole</strong> (contraction) and <strong>Diastole</strong> (relaxation). These phases are further subdivided into events that control the movement of blood through the heart.</p>
<h3 id="1-atrial-systole">1. <strong>Atrial Systole</strong></h3>
<p>Atrial systole occurs at the beginning of the cardiac cycle, when the atria contract to push blood into the ventricles. This phase lasts for about 0.1 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>atria</strong> contract, increasing the pressure inside the atrial chambers.</li>
<li>This pressure forces blood into the ventricles through the <strong>atrioventricular (AV) valves</strong>.</li>
<li>The AV valves open while the semilunar valves (located at the exits of the ventricles) remain closed to prevent backflow into the ventricles.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-ventricular-systole">2. <strong>Ventricular Systole</strong></h3>
<p>During ventricular systole, the ventricles contract, increasing their pressure and forcing blood out of the heart. This phase lasts for about 0.3 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>ventricles</strong> contract, increasing pressure inside the ventricles.</li>
<li>The increased pressure forces the AV valves to close, preventing backflow into the atria.</li>
<li>The <strong>semilunar valves</strong> (pulmonary and aortic valves) open, allowing blood to flow into the pulmonary artery and the aorta.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-early-diastole">3. <strong>Early Diastole</strong></h3>
<p>Early diastole is the relaxation phase of the heart cycle, occurring after the ventricular contraction.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ventricles begin to relax, and the pressure within the ventricles decreases.</li>
<li>The <strong>semilunar valves</strong> close to prevent blood from flowing back into the ventricles.</li>
<li>The AV valves remain closed at first, preventing blood from flowing back into the atria.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-late-diastole">4. <strong>Late Diastole</strong></h3>
<p>Late diastole occurs when both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. This phase lasts for about 0.4 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood from the veins flows into the atria, filling them with blood.</li>
<li>The AV valves open as the pressure in the atria becomes higher than the pressure in the ventricles.</li>
<li>The ventricles begin to fill with blood, preparing for the next cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview-of-pressure-changes">Overview of Pressure Changes</h2>
<p>During the cardiac cycle, there are distinct changes in pressure within the heart&rsquo;s chambers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atrial Pressure</strong>: Increases during atrial systole as the atria contract and forces blood into the ventricles.</li>
<li><strong>Ventricular Pressure</strong>: Increases during ventricular systole as the ventricles contract to pump blood.</li>
<li><strong>Aortic Pressure</strong>: Increases as blood is ejected into the aorta, then gradually decreases as the blood moves throughout the body.</li>
</ul>
<p>The movement of blood through the heart and the pressure changes are critical to understanding how the heart efficiently pumps blood. These changes also contribute to the <strong>heart sounds</strong> (S1 and S2), which are caused by the closure of the valves during different phases of the cycle.</p>
<h2 id="heart-sounds">Heart Sounds</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>S1</strong>: The first heart sound, caused by the closure of the AV valves during the beginning of ventricular systole.</li>
<li><strong>S2</strong>: The second heart sound, caused by the closure of the semilunar valves at the end of ventricular systole.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The cardiac cycle involves a series of coordinated events that regulate the contraction and relaxation of the heart chambers. It includes atrial systole, ventricular systole, and the relaxation phases of early and late diastole. Pressure changes and valve movements ensure that blood is efficiently pumped and circulated through the body.</p>

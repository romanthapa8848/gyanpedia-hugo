         <h1 id="electrolytic-and-colorimetric-analysis">Electrolytic and Colorimetric Analysis</h1>
<p>Electrolytic and colorimetric analyses are widely used in environmental chemistry for determining the concentration of substances in various samples. These methods rely on electrical and color changes in a sample, respectively, to quantify the amount of a particular compound present. Both techniques are fundamental in areas like water quality testing, pollution monitoring, and chemical analysis in environmental studies.</p>
<h3 id="1-electrolytic-analysis">1. <strong>Electrolytic Analysis</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Electrolytic analysis</strong> involves the use of electrical energy to drive chemical reactions, enabling the analysis of substances based on the amount of electrical current or potential required for a reaction. This method is often used for the determination of metal ions or other electrolytes in environmental samples.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Function</strong>: Electrolytic analysis measures the current or voltage required to induce a reaction, helping to determine the concentration of ions in the solution.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>: It is commonly used in the analysis of metals like copper, zinc, and lead in water, soil, and air samples.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: <strong>Electrolysis</strong> of a water sample to determine the concentration of chloride ions by measuring the electric current required for the reaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-colorimetric-analysis">2. <strong>Colorimetric Analysis</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Colorimetric analysis</strong> is based on the principle of measuring the color intensity of a solution, which correlates with the concentration of the analyte. When a reagent is added to a sample, a colored complex may form, and the intensity of the color is proportional to the concentration of the analyte.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Function</strong>: The concentration of a substance is determined by measuring the absorption or transmission of light at a specific wavelength by the colored complex formed.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>: It is frequently used in water and soil testing to measure parameters such as nitrate levels, phosphate levels, and dissolved oxygen.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: <strong>The determination of nitrate concentration</strong> in water by adding a reagent that forms a yellow complex, and the intensity of the yellow color is measured using a colorimeter.</li>

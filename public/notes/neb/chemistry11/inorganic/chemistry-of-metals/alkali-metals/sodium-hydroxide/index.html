<p>Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), commonly known as <strong>caustic soda</strong>, is a highly corrosive and strong base used in a wide range of industrial applications. Sodium hydroxide is typically produced by the <strong>electrolysis of sodium chloride (NaCl)</strong>, and it plays a crucial role in various chemical reactions.</p>
<h2 id="properties-of-sodium-hydroxide">Properties of Sodium Hydroxide</h2>
<h3 id="1-precipitation-reaction">1. <strong>Precipitation Reaction</strong>:</h3>
<p>Sodium hydroxide readily reacts with various metal salts to form insoluble hydroxides, a reaction known as a <strong>precipitation reaction</strong>. These precipitates are often used in qualitative analysis and industrial processes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: When NaOH reacts with <strong>copper(II) sulfate (CuSO₄)</strong>, <strong>copper(II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)₂)</strong> is precipitated:
</p>
$$ \text{CuSO}_4 (aq) + 2NaOH (aq) \rightarrow \text{Cu(OH)}_2 (s) + Na_2SO_4 (aq) $$</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: When NaOH reacts with <strong>iron(III) chloride (FeCl₃)</strong>, <strong>iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃)</strong> is precipitated:
</p>
$$ \text{FeCl}_3 (aq) + 3NaOH (aq) \rightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 (s) + 3NaCl (aq) $$</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-action-with-carbon-monoxide">2. <strong>Action with Carbon Monoxide</strong>:</h3>
<p>Sodium hydroxide reacts with <strong>carbon monoxide (CO)</strong> to form <strong>sodium formate (HCOONa)</strong>. This reaction is important in the production of formic acid and its derivatives.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reaction</strong>:
$$ CO + NaOH \rightarrow HCOONa $$</li>
</ul>
<p>This reaction is utilized in various chemical processes, such as the preparation of formic acid and in the manufacture of certain chemicals used in the textile and leather industries.</p>

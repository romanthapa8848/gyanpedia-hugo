<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, has long been considered a potential alternative fuel due to its high energy content and environmentally friendly properties. When used as fuel, hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water, producing energy without harmful emissions, making it a clean energy source. This has led to growing interest in hydrogen as a fuel for a variety of applications, especially in the energy and transportation sectors.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-hydrogen-fuel-cells">1. <strong>Hydrogen Fuel Cells</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most promising applications of hydrogen is in <strong>hydrogen fuel cells</strong>. These cells convert chemical energy from hydrogen into electrical energy through an electrochemical reaction with oxygen. The reaction produces electricity, water, and heat, making fuel cells an efficient and clean energy source.</p>
<h3 id="working-of-a-hydrogen-fuel-cell">Working of a Hydrogen Fuel Cell:</h3>
<p>In a hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen gas (H₂) is fed into the anode side of the cell, while oxygen (O₂) is supplied to the cathode side. At the anode, hydrogen molecules are split into protons and electrons. The electrons travel through an external circuit, creating an electric current, while the protons move through an electrolyte membrane to the cathode, where they combine with oxygen and electrons to form water (H₂O).</p>

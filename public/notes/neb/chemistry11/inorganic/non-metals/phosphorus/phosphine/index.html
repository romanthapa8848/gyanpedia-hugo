<p>Phosphine (PH₃) is a colorless, flammable, and toxic gas that has a pungent odor similar to rotten fish. It is a hydride of phosphorus and exhibits significant chemical reactivity. Phosphine is an important compound in the chemistry of phosphorus and is used in various industrial applications.</p>
<h2 id="preparation-of-phosphine">Preparation of Phosphine</h2>
<p>Phosphine can be prepared in the laboratory by the following methods:</p>
<h3 id="1-reaction-of-white-phosphorus-with-sodium-hydroxide">1. Reaction of White Phosphorus with Sodium Hydroxide</h3>
<p>White phosphorus reacts with <strong>sodium hydroxide (NaOH)</strong> in the presence of water to produce phosphine:</p>
$$

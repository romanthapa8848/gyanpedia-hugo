  <div class="math-content"><h1 id="structure-of-ozone">Structure of Ozone</h1>
<p>Ozone ($\text{O}_3$) is a molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms. It is an important molecule in the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, especially in the stratosphere, where it forms the ozone layer that protects us from harmful ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="molecular-geometry">Molecular Geometry</h2>
<p>The structure of the ozone molecule is bent or V-shaped, with an angle of approximately 117°. This geometry is due to the repulsion between the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms.</p>
<h3 id="resonance-structure">Resonance Structure</h3>
<p>Ozone has a resonance structure, meaning that the bonding in ozone is not fixed but is spread out over the entire molecule. The actual structure of ozone is an average of the resonance structures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resonance structures</strong> show that there is a partial double bond character between each oxygen atom, but no single bond or double bond is fixed in place. This allows the electrons to be delocalized over the molecule.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chemical-bonding">Chemical Bonding</h3>
<p>In ozone, the oxygen atoms are held together by covalent bonds. However, due to the resonance effect, the bond order between the oxygen atoms is 1.5, which is intermediate between a single and a double bond.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lewis-structure">Lewis Structure</h2>
<p>The Lewis structure of ozone can be represented as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The central oxygen atom forms a single bond with one oxygen atom and a double bond with the other oxygen atom.</li>
<li>The formal charges are distributed in such a way that the central oxygen atom has a formal charge of 0, while the terminal oxygen atoms carry a formal charge of -1 each.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Lewis structure is:</p>
$$\text{O} = \text{O} - \text{O}$$<p>The bonds in ozone are not fixed. Due to resonance, the molecule constantly oscillates between these structures, giving rise to an average bond character.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hybridization">Hybridization</h2>
<p>Each oxygen atom in ozone undergoes <strong>sp² hybridization</strong>. In the sp² hybridization:</p>
<ul>
<li>One s orbital and two p orbitals combine to form three sp² hybrid orbitals.</li>
<li>Two of these sp² hybrid orbitals form sigma bonds with other oxygen atoms, while the third one holds a lone pair of electrons.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to the bent shape of the molecule with an angle of approximately 117°, which is typical for molecules with sp² hybridization.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="important-properties-of-ozone">Important Properties of Ozone</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Molecular Formula:</strong> $\text{O}_3$</li>
<li><strong>Bonding:</strong> Covalent bonds with delocalized electrons due to resonance.</li>
<li><strong>Shape:</strong> Bent or V-shaped.</li>
<li><strong>Bond Angle:</strong> Approximately 117°.</li>
<li><strong>Bond Order:</strong> 1.5 (due to resonance).</li>
<li><strong>Bond Length:</strong> Intermediate between a single and a double bond.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Ozone ($\text{O}_3$) is a bent molecule with three oxygen atoms. It has a resonance structure, where the bonding is delocalized over the molecule. The bonds are a combination of single and double bonds, giving a bond order of 1.5. The molecule is <strong>sp² hybridized</strong> and has a bond angle of about 117°. Ozone plays a crucial role in protecting the Earth from harmful UV radiation and is widely studied in chemistry for its unique structure and bonding.</p>

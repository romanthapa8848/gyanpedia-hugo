<p>Stoichiometry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It is based on several fundamental laws that describe the relationships between the amounts of substances involved in a reaction.</p>
<h3 id="the-main-laws-of-stoichiometry-are">The main laws of stoichiometry are:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Law of Conservation of Mass</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed by Antoine Lavoisier, this law states that <strong>matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction</strong>. The total mass of the reactants is always equal to the total mass of the products.</li>
<li>This law forms the basis for stoichiometry because it implies that the quantities of reactants and products must balance in any chemical reaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Law of Definite Proportions</strong> (also known as Proust&rsquo;s Law)</p>
<ul>
<li>This law, proposed by Joseph Proust, states that a given compound always contains the same elements in the same proportion by mass, no matter the size or source of the sample.</li>
<li>For example, water (H₂O) will always contain <strong>2 grams of hydrogen for every 16 grams of oxygen</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Law of Multiple Proportions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed by John Dalton, this law states that when two elements combine to form more than one compound, the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other element are in simple whole-number ratios.</li>
<li>For example, nitrogen and oxygen can combine to form both nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂). In NO, for every 14 grams of nitrogen, there are 16 grams of oxygen. In NO₂, for every 14 grams of nitrogen, there are 32 grams of oxygen. The ratio of the masses of oxygen in the two compounds is 1:2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="example-application-of-stoichiometric-laws">Example Application of Stoichiometric Laws:</h2>
<p>Consider the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water:</p>
$$
2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O
$$<ul>
<li>According to the <strong>Law of Conservation of Mass</strong>, the total mass of hydrogen and oxygen before the reaction must equal the total mass of water produced.</li>
<li>The <strong>Law of Definite Proportions</strong> tells us that water always contains hydrogen and oxygen in a fixed ratio, regardless of the amount produced.</li>
<li>The <strong>Law of Multiple Proportions</strong> can be applied when considering different compounds of hydrogen and oxygen, such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), where the ratio of oxygen to hydrogen is different.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stoichiometry</strong> is based on three key laws: the Law of Conservation of Mass, the Law of Definite Proportions, and the Law of Multiple Proportions.</li>
<li>These laws allow chemists to calculate the amounts of reactants and products in chemical reactions and understand how substances combine.</li>
<li>The laws provide the foundation for the calculation of empirical formulas, molecular formulas, and the analysis of chemical reactions.</li>

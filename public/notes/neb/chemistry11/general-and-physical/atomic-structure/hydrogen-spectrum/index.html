<p>The spectrum of the hydrogen atom is a set of discrete lines produced when electrons transition between quantized energy levels in the atom. These spectral lines can be observed in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, including the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared regions. The study of the hydrogen spectrum played a significant role in the development of atomic models, particularly Bohr&rsquo;s model.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="bohrs-explanation-of-hydrogen-spectrum">Bohr’s Explanation of Hydrogen Spectrum</h2>
<p>In Bohr’s model, electrons in hydrogen move in specific, quantized orbits or energy levels around the nucleus. These energy levels are labeled by the principal quantum number $n$, where $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$.</p>
<p>When an electron in a hydrogen atom transitions from one energy level to another, it emits or absorbs electromagnetic radiation (photons) whose energy corresponds to the difference between the two energy levels. This is what produces the hydrogen atom’s spectral lines.</p>
<p>The energy of the $n$-th orbit in the hydrogen atom is given by:</p>
$$
E_n = - \frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}
$$<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$E_n$ is the energy of the $n$-th orbit</li>
<li>$n$ is the principal quantum number (1, 2, 3,&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="spectral-series-of-hydrogen-atom">Spectral Series of Hydrogen Atom</h2>
<p>The spectral lines of the hydrogen atom are classified into series based on the final energy level of the electron. The most important series are:</p>
<h3 id="1-lyman-series-ultraviolet-region">1. <strong>Lyman Series (Ultraviolet Region)</strong></h3>
<p>The Lyman series corresponds to transitions where the final energy level is $n = 1$. These transitions produce ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p>The wavelength of the emitted photon can be calculated using the Rydberg formula:</p>
$$
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{n^2} \right) \quad (n = 2, 3, 4, \dots)
$$<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\lambda$ is the wavelength of the emitted photon</li>
<li>$R_H$ is the Rydberg constant ($1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1}$)</li>
<li>$n$ is the initial energy level, with $n > 1$</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-balmer-series-visible-region">2. <strong>Balmer Series (Visible Region)</strong></h3>
<p>The Balmer series corresponds to transitions where the final energy level is $n = 2$. The spectral lines of this series are visible to the human eye and include the famous red line in the hydrogen spectrum.</p>
<p>The wavelengths of these lines are given by:</p>
$$
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2} \right) \quad (n = 3, 4, 5, \dots)
$$<p>The first few lines in the Balmer series are in the visible region, and the wavelengths correspond to colors like red, blue, and violet.</p>
<h3 id="3-paschen-series-infrared-region">3. <strong>Paschen Series (Infrared Region)</strong></h3>
<p>The Paschen series corresponds to transitions where the final energy level is $n = 3$. These spectral lines are in the infrared region and are not visible to the human eye.</p>
<p>The wavelengths of these lines can be found using:</p>
$$
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{1}{n^2} \right) \quad (n = 4, 5, 6, \dots)
$$<h3 id="4-brackett-series-infrared-region">4. <strong>Brackett Series (Infrared Region)</strong></h3>
<p>The Brackett series corresponds to transitions where the final energy level is $n = 4$. These lines also lie in the infrared region.</p>
<h3 id="5-pfund-series-infrared-region">5. <strong>Pfund Series (Infrared Region)</strong></h3>
<p>The Pfund series corresponds to transitions where the final energy level is $n = 5$. Like the Paschen and Brackett series, these lines are in the infrared region.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The spectrum of the hydrogen atom consists of discrete spectral lines produced by the transitions of electrons between different energy levels. These spectral lines are categorized into various series, including the Lyman, Balmer, Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund series. The Balmer series is the only one visible to the human eye, and it forms the red, blue, and violet lines seen in the hydrogen spectrum. Bohr’s model successfully explains these spectral lines by treating the electron&rsquo;s energy levels as quantized.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<h3 id="1-what-is-the-lyman-series">1. What is the Lyman series?</h3>
<p>The Lyman series consists of spectral lines produced when an electron in a hydrogen atom transitions to the $n = 1$ energy level, emitting ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<h3 id="2-which-spectral-series-is-visible-to-the-human-eye">2. Which spectral series is visible to the human eye?</h3>
<p>The <strong>Balmer series</strong> is visible to the human eye and consists of spectral lines in the red, blue, and violet regions of the spectrum.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-is-the-rydberg-formula">3. What is the Rydberg formula?</h3>
<p>The Rydberg formula is used to calculate the wavelengths of the spectral lines in the hydrogen atom:</p>
$$
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right)
$$<p>Where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the initial and final energy levels, respectively, and $R_H$ is the Rydberg constant.</p>
<h3 id="4-how-does-bohrs-model-explain-the-hydrogen-spectrum">4. How does Bohr’s model explain the hydrogen spectrum?</h3>
<p>Bohr’s model explains the hydrogen spectrum by proposing that electrons exist in quantized energy levels and emit or absorb photons when they transition between these levels.</p>
<h3 id="5-what-is-the-significance-of-the-balmer-series">5. What is the significance of the Balmer series?</h3>
<p>The Balmer series provides the visible spectral lines of the hydrogen atom and is important for understanding the emission of light in the visible region.</p>
<h3 id="6-what-is-the-principal-quantum-number-n">6. What is the principal quantum number $n$?</h3>
<p>The principal quantum number $n$ indicates the energy level or orbit in which an electron resides. For hydrogen, $n = 1, 2, 3,...$.</p>
<h3 id="7-how-are-the-spectral-lines-of-hydrogen-produced">7. How are the spectral lines of hydrogen produced?</h3>
<p>The spectral lines are produced when an electron moves from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, emitting or absorbing photons with specific energies.</p>
<h3 id="8-why-are-hydrogens-spectral-lines-discrete">8. Why are hydrogen&rsquo;s spectral lines discrete?</h3>
<p>Hydrogen&rsquo;s spectral lines are discrete because the electron in the hydrogen atom can only occupy specific, quantized energy levels.</p>
<h3 id="9-what-is-the-difference-between-the-lyman-and-balmer-series">9. What is the difference between the Lyman and Balmer series?</h3>
<p>The <strong>Lyman series</strong> consists of ultraviolet lines produced by transitions to $n = 1$, while the <strong>Balmer series</strong> consists of visible lines produced by transitions to $n = 2$.</p>
<h3 id="10-can-bohrs-model-explain-the-spectra-of-atoms-other-than-hydrogen">10. Can Bohr’s model explain the spectra of atoms other than hydrogen?</h3>
<p>Bohr&rsquo;s model works well for hydrogen, but it cannot accurately explain the spectra of atoms with more than one electron, due to the complexity introduced by electron-electron interactions.</p>

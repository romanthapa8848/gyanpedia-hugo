<p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the study of matter, its properties, structure, composition, and the changes it undergoes during chemical reactions. It plays a key role in understanding the physical and chemical aspects of substances and materials in our environment.</p>
<p>Chemistry is often referred to as the &ldquo;central science&rdquo; because it connects and overlaps with various other scientific disciplines such as biology, physics, geology, and environmental science. It helps in developing new materials, medicines, and technologies that impact every aspect of our daily lives.</p>

         <h1 id="basic-concepts-of-chemistry">Basic Concepts of Chemistry</h1>
<p>Chemistry is built on fundamental concepts like atoms, molecules, and their interactions. These basic units and their properties form the foundation for understanding chemical reactions and processes. Key concepts such as the atomic mass unit (amu), radicals, and the differences between molecular and empirical formulas are central to grasping the complexities of chemistry.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="atoms">Atoms</h2>
<p>An atom is the basic unit of matter and is the smallest part of an element that retains all the properties of that element. An atom consists of three subatomic particles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protons</strong>: Positively charged particles found in the nucleus.</li>
<li><strong>Neutrons</strong>: Neutral particles also located in the nucleus.</li>
<li><strong>Electrons</strong>: Negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in energy levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus determines the element, and the number of electrons determines its chemical properties.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="molecules">Molecules</h2>
<p>A molecule is formed when two or more atoms bond together chemically. Molecules can be made up of the same or different types of atoms. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oxygen (O₂)</strong> is a molecule made up of two oxygen atoms.</li>
<li><strong>Water (H₂O)</strong> is a molecule made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Molecules are the smallest units of compounds that can exist independently and still retain the chemical properties of the compound.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="atomic-mass-unit-amu">Atomic Mass Unit (amu)</h2>
<p>The atomic mass unit (amu) is a standard unit of mass used to express the masses of atoms and molecules. It is defined as one twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The amu provides a convenient way to compare the mass of different atoms.</p>
<p>For example, a carbon-12 atom has a mass of exactly 12 amu, and a hydrogen atom has a mass of approximately 1 amu.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="radicals">Radicals</h2>
<p>In chemistry, a <strong>radical</strong> (or free radical) refers to an atom or molecule that has an unpaired electron in its outermost shell. Radicals are highly reactive because they tend to seek out and pair up with other electrons. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hydroxyl radical (OH)</strong>: This radical contains one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom, and it plays a role in many chemical reactions, including combustion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Radicals are important in organic chemistry, particularly in the process of polymerization and many types of chemical reactions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="molecular-formula">Molecular Formula</h2>
<p>A <strong>molecular formula</strong> represents the exact number and types of atoms in a molecule. It shows how many atoms of each element are present in a compound, without indicating the structure or arrangement of those atoms. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water (H₂O)</strong>: The molecular formula tells us that one molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.</li>
<li><strong>Carbon dioxide (CO₂)</strong>: The molecular formula indicates that one molecule of carbon dioxide consists of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The molecular formula is useful for understanding the composition of a compound.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="empirical-formula">Empirical Formula</h2>
<p>An <strong>empirical formula</strong> represents the simplest whole-number ratio of elements in a compound. Unlike the molecular formula, which shows the exact number of atoms, the empirical formula gives the simplest ratio of the elements. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)</strong> has an empirical formula of <strong>CH₂O</strong>, because the ratio of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in glucose is 1:2:1.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)</strong> has an empirical formula of <strong>HO</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The empirical formula is important in situations where the actual structure of the compound is unknown, or when simplifying the composition for analysis.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atoms</strong> are the smallest units of elements that retain the properties of that element.</li>
<li><strong>Molecules</strong> are formed when atoms bond together.</li>
<li>The <strong>atomic mass unit (amu)</strong> is used to express the mass of atoms and molecules.</li>
<li><strong>Radicals</strong> are highly reactive atoms or groups of atoms with unpaired electrons.</li>
<li>A <strong>molecular formula</strong> gives the exact number of atoms of each element in a molecule.</li>
<li>The <strong>empirical formula</strong> shows the simplest ratio of elements in a compound.</li>

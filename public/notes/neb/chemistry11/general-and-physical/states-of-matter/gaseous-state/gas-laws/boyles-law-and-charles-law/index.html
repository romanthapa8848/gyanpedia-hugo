<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Boyle&rsquo;s and Charles&rsquo;s laws are fundamental concepts in thermodynamics and gas behavior. Both laws describe the relationship between the physical properties of gases—<strong>pressure</strong>, <strong>volume</strong>, and <strong>temperature</strong>—under varying conditions. They were derived empirically through experimental observations and have become essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of gases.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="boyles-law">Boyle’s Law</h2>
<p>Boyle&rsquo;s Law, named after physicist Robert Boyle, states that:</p>
<p><strong>The pressure of a given mass of gas is inversely proportional to its volume, provided the temperature is kept constant.</strong></p>
<p>Mathematically, Boyle’s Law is expressed as:</p>
$$
P \propto \frac{1}{V}
$$<p>or</p>
$$
P V = \text{constant}
$$<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$P$ is the pressure of the gas,</li>
<li>$V$ is the volume of the gas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>
<p>According to Boyle’s Law, when the volume of a gas decreases, the pressure increases, and vice versa, as long as the temperature and the amount of gas remain constant. This inverse relationship can be visualized by compressing or expanding a gas inside a container. As the volume reduces, the gas molecules collide with the walls more frequently, causing an increase in pressure.</p>
<h3 id="mathematical-derivation">Mathematical Derivation</h3>
<p>Let us assume that the temperature and the number of gas molecules are constant. If a gas has an initial pressure $P_1$ and an initial volume $V_1$, and is then compressed to a final volume $V_2$, the final pressure will be $P_2$. Boyle’s Law can be expressed as:</p>
$$
P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2
$$<p>Thus, the product of pressure and volume remains constant at a given temperature.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="charless-law">Charles&rsquo;s Law</h2>
<p>Charles’s Law, discovered by Jacques Charles, states that:</p>
<p><strong>The volume of a given mass of gas is directly proportional to its temperature, provided the pressure is kept constant.</strong></p>
<p>Mathematically, Charles’s Law is expressed as:</p>
$$
V \propto T
$$<p>or</p>
$$
\frac{V}{T} = \text{constant}
$$<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$V$ is the volume of the gas,</li>
<li>$T$ is the temperature of the gas (measured in Kelvin).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="explanation-1">Explanation</h3>
<p>Charles’s Law suggests that as the temperature of a gas increases, the volume increases, provided the pressure remains constant. This is because, at higher temperatures, gas molecules move faster, colliding more frequently and with greater force against the walls of the container. To maintain constant pressure, the gas expands to provide more space for these energetic molecules.</p>
<h3 id="mathematical-derivation-1">Mathematical Derivation</h3>
<p>Let us assume that the pressure and the number of gas molecules are constant. If a gas has an initial volume $V_1$ and an initial temperature $T_1$, and is then heated to a final temperature $T_2$, the final volume will be $V_2$. Charles’s Law can be expressed as:</p>
$$
\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}
$$<p>Thus, the ratio of the volume of the gas to its temperature remains constant, provided the pressure remains unchanged.</p>

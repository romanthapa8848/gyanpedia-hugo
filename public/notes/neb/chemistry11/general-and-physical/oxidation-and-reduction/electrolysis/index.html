<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Electrolysis</strong> is the process of using electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction. It occurs in an <strong>electrolytic cell</strong>, where an external electric current is passed through an electrolyte, causing chemical reactions at the electrodes.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="electrolytic-cell">Electrolytic Cell</h2>
<p>An <strong>electrolytic cell</strong> consists of two electrodes: the <strong>cathode</strong> and the <strong>anode</strong>, which are submerged in an electrolyte solution. The electrolyte contains free ions that can move under the influence of the electric current.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cathode</strong>: The electrode where <strong>reduction</strong> (gain of electrons) occurs. It is negatively charged.</li>
<li><strong>Anode</strong>: The electrode where <strong>oxidation</strong> (loss of electrons) occurs. It is positively charged.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="process-of-electrolysis">Process of Electrolysis</h2>
<p>When electric current is passed through an electrolyte:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Anions</strong> (negative ions) move towards the anode, where they lose electrons (oxidation).</li>
<li><strong>Cations</strong> (positive ions) move towards the cathode, where they gain electrons (reduction).</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="faradays-laws-of-electrolysis">Faraday’s Laws of Electrolysis</h2>
<p>The laws governing electrolysis are formulated by Michael Faraday:</p>
<h3 id="1-faradays-first-law">1. <strong>Faraday’s First Law</strong>:</h3>
<p>The amount of substance deposited or liberated at an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of electric charge passed through the electrolyte.</p>
$$
m = Z \cdot Q
$$<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$m$ is the mass of the substance deposited or liberated.</li>
<li>$Z$ is the electrochemical equivalent (a constant for the substance).</li>
<li>$Q$ is the total charge passed, which is the product of current and time: $Q = I \cdot t$.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-faradays-second-law">2. <strong>Faraday’s Second Law</strong>:</h3>
<p>The amount of different substances deposited or liberated by the same quantity of electric charge is proportional to their equivalent weights.</p>
$$
\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \frac{E_1}{E_2}
$$<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the substances deposited or liberated.</li>
<li>$E_1$ and $E_2$ are their respective equivalent weights.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="applications-of-electrolysis">Applications of Electrolysis</h2>
<p>Electrolysis has many important applications, including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Electroplating</strong>: Electrolytic process used to coat a metal object with a thin layer of another metal.</li>
<li><strong>Electrorefining of Metals</strong>: Purification of metals like copper by removing impurities.</li>
<li><strong>Production of Chlorine and Sodium Hydroxide</strong>: Electrolysis of brine ($NaCl$ solution) produces chlorine gas at the anode and sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas at the cathode.</li>
<li><strong>Electrosynthesis of Compounds</strong>: Electrolysis is used in the synthesis of chemicals like hydrogen, oxygen, and various organic compounds.</li>
<li><strong>Extraction of Metals</strong>: Electrolysis is used to extract reactive metals such as aluminium from their ores.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="example-of-electrolysis-electrolysis-of-water">Example of Electrolysis: Electrolysis of Water</h2>
<p>When water ($H_2O$) is electrolyzed, it splits into hydrogen and oxygen gases:</p>
<h3 id="reaction-at-the-cathode-reduction">Reaction at the Cathode (Reduction):</h3>
$$
2H_2O + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2 + 2OH^-
$$<h3 id="reaction-at-the-anode-oxidation">Reaction at the Anode (Oxidation):</h3>
$$
4OH^- \rightarrow O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^-
$$<p>The overall reaction is:</p>
$$
2H_2O \rightarrow 2H_2 + O_2
$$<p>Thus, water decomposes into hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Electrolysis</strong> is a technique used to drive non-spontaneous chemical reactions by passing an electric current through an electrolyte. The process is governed by <strong>Faraday&rsquo;s laws</strong>, and it has numerous applications, such as electroplating, electrorefining of metals, and the production of gases like hydrogen and oxygen.</p>

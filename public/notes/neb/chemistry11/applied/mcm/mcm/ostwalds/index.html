<p>The manufacture of nitric acid (HNO₃) is a crucial process in industrial chemistry, particularly for the production of fertilizers, explosives, and other chemicals. The <strong>Ostwald Process</strong> is the most widely used method for the large-scale production of nitric acid.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-chemical-reactions">1. Chemical Reactions</h2>
<p>The Ostwald Process involves the oxidation of ammonia to produce nitric oxide (NO), which is then further oxidized to nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and finally absorbed in water to form nitric acid.</p>
<p>The key reactions involved are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide (NO):</strong>
</p>
$$
4NH₃ (g) + 3O₂ (g) \xrightarrow{Pt, 900°C} 2N₂ (g) + 6H₂O (g)
$$</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide (NO₂):</strong>
</p>
$$
2NO (g) + O₂ (g) \xrightarrow{450°C} 2NO₂ (g)
$$</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Absorption of nitrogen dioxide in water to form nitric acid:</strong>
</p>
$$
2NO₂ (g) + H₂O (l) \xrightarrow{} HNO₃ (aq) + HNO₂ (aq)
$$</li>
</ol>
<p>In the final step, the nitric acid is concentrated and purified to produce the desired product.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-conditions-for-the-ostwald-process">2. Conditions for the Ostwald Process</h2>
<p>To achieve the required reactions efficiently, specific conditions are used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature</strong>: The reaction occurs at high temperatures (around 900°C) in the presence of a platinum (Pt) catalyst.</li>
<li><strong>Catalyst</strong>: Platinum or rhodium is commonly used as a catalyst for the oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide. These metals are effective due to their high reactivity and ability to withstand the harsh conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Pressure</strong>: Moderate pressures are used during the oxidation stages, but the final absorption step occurs at atmospheric pressure.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-steps-involved-in-the-ostwald-process">3. Steps Involved in the Ostwald Process</h2>
<h3 id="a-preparation-of-ammonia">a) <strong>Preparation of Ammonia</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ammonia gas is prepared either from the Haber Process or directly from natural gas. It is purified before being fed into the reactor.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-oxidation-of-ammonia">b) <strong>Oxidation of Ammonia</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The purified ammonia is mixed with air and passed over a heated platinum catalyst at around 900°C. The reaction oxidizes ammonia to nitric oxide (NO) and water vapor.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-oxidation-of-nitric-oxide-to-nitrogen-dioxide">c) <strong>Oxidation of Nitric Oxide to Nitrogen Dioxide</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The nitric oxide is further oxidized by oxygen at 450°C to form nitrogen dioxide (NO₂).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-absorption-of-nitrogen-dioxide">d) <strong>Absorption of Nitrogen Dioxide</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The nitrogen dioxide is absorbed in water to form nitric acid. This step may produce a mixture of nitric acid and nitrous acid (HNO₂), which can be further treated to produce pure nitric acid.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="e-concentration-of-nitric-acid">e) <strong>Concentration of Nitric Acid</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The dilute nitric acid formed in the absorption step is concentrated by distillation or other processes to obtain concentrated nitric acid, which is commercially used.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-importance-of-nitric-acid">4. Importance of Nitric Acid</h2>
<p>Nitric acid is an essential industrial chemical. Its primary uses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The production of <strong>ammonium nitrate</strong> for fertilizers and explosives.</li>
<li>The manufacture of <strong>nitrocompounds</strong>, including TNT (trinitrotoluene), which is used in the defense industry.</li>
<li><strong>Pickling of metals</strong>, particularly in the automotive and steel industries.</li>
<li>As a <strong>reagent</strong> in laboratories and chemical syntheses.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-efficiency-and-yield">5. Efficiency and Yield</h2>
<p>The Ostwald Process is highly efficient, but it still operates at a moderate yield due to the need for high temperatures and the expensive platinum catalyst. The process is continuously optimized to improve yield and reduce energy consumption.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The Ostwald Process is a vital industrial method for producing nitric acid, which plays a significant role in fertilizer production, explosives manufacturing, and other chemical industries. By using high temperatures, a platinum catalyst, and moderate pressures, the process efficiently converts ammonia into nitric acid through a series of oxidation and absorption reactions.</p>

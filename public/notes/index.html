    <h1 id="abnormal-behaviour-of-methanoic-acid">Abnormal Behaviour of Methanoic Acid</h1>
<p>Methanoic acid ($\ce{HCOOH}$), commonly known as formic acid, is an important carboxylic acid found in nature, particularly in the venom of some insects. Unlike other simple carboxylic acids, methanoic acid exhibits some abnormal behaviour due to its molecular structure and chemical properties.</p>
<h2 id="key-reasons-for-abnormal-behaviour">Key Reasons for Abnormal Behaviour</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In methanoic acid, the hydrogen atom of the $\ce{-OH}$ group of the carboxyl group can form an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group ($\ce{C=O}$). This interaction reduces the availability of the hydroxyl group for proton dissociation.</li>
<li>This hydrogen bonding stabilizes the molecule and affects its reactivity compared to other carboxylic acids.</li>

    <h1 id="geometrical-and-optical-isomerism">Geometrical and Optical Isomerism</h1>
<h2 id="geometrical-isomerism">Geometrical Isomerism</h2>
<p>Geometrical isomerism, also known as <strong>cis-trans isomerism</strong>, arises in compounds with restricted rotation, typically around a double bond or in certain ring structures. In geometrical isomers, atoms or groups are positioned differently in space, leading to distinct <strong>cis</strong> and <strong>trans</strong> forms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cis Isomer</strong>: In the cis isomer, similar or identical groups are located on the <strong>same side</strong> of the double bond or ring.</li>
<li><strong>Trans Isomer</strong>: In the trans isomer, similar or identical groups are located on <strong>opposite sides</strong> of the double bond or ring.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in 2-butene ($C_4H_8$), the cis isomer has both methyl ($CH_3$) groups on the same side of the double bond, while the trans isomer has them on opposite sides.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Real gases do not behave exactly as ideal gases, especially under high pressure or low temperature conditions. The <strong>Ideal Gas Law</strong> assumes no interactions between gas molecules and that the volume of gas molecules is negligible. However, real gases have intermolecular forces, and the volume occupied by gas molecules themselves cannot be ignored under certain conditions, leading to deviations from ideal behavior.</p>

<h2 id="reasons-for-deviation-from-ideal-gas-behavior">Reasons for Deviation from Ideal Gas Behavior</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Intermolecular Forces</strong>:
In ideal gases, it is assumed that gas molecules do not exert any forces on one another. However, in real gases, there are attractive and repulsive forces between molecules, which affect their behavior. These forces become particularly significant under conditions of high pressure (when molecules are close together) and low temperature (when molecules move slower).</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-electron-affinity">Introduction to Electron Affinity</h2>
<p><strong>Electron Affinity (EA)</strong> is defined as the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom in the gaseous state to form a negative ion. The process can be represented as:</p>
$$
\text{X (g)} + e^- \rightarrow \text{X}^- (g)
$$<p>where <strong>X</strong> is the element and <strong>e⁻</strong> is the electron being added.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electron affinity</strong> values can be positive (exothermic) or negative (endothermic), but elements that release energy upon gaining an electron (typically nonmetals) have a <strong>positive electron affinity</strong> value.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="factors-affecting-electron-affinity">Factors Affecting Electron Affinity</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Atomic Size</strong>: Smaller atoms have higher electron affinity as the added electron is closer to the nucleus and experiences a stronger attraction.</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear Charge</strong>: A higher nuclear charge increases the electron affinity because the nucleus more strongly attracts the added electron.</li>
<li><strong>Electron Shielding</strong>: Increased electron shielding (more inner shells) reduces effective nuclear attraction on the added electron, decreasing electron affinity.</li>
<li><strong>Electron Configuration</strong>: Elements with stable electron configurations (like noble gases) have low or even negative electron affinities as they resist gaining additional electrons.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Across a Period</strong>: Electron affinity generally increases from left to right across a period, as atomic size decreases and nuclear charge increases.</li>
<li><strong>Down a Group</strong>: Electron affinity generally decreases down a group due to an increase in atomic size and electron shielding, which reduces the attraction between the nucleus and the added electron.</li>

<h2 id="introduction-to-ionic-character">Introduction to Ionic Character</h2>
<p><strong>Ionic character</strong> refers to the extent to which a bond between two atoms behaves like an ionic bond, as opposed to a purely covalent bond. In a purely ionic bond, electrons are completely transferred from one atom to another, whereas in a covalent bond, electrons are shared between atoms.</p>
<p>Ionic character is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms involved in the bond. The greater the difference in electronegativity, the greater the ionic character of the bond. While ionic bonds are typically formed between metals and non-metals, covalent bonds are formed between two non-metals.</p>

These trends result from the systematic arrangement of elements according to their atomic numbers, which influences their electronic configurations. Key periodic trends include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Atomic Radius</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Across a Period</strong>: Atomic radius decreases from left to right across a period due to an increase in effective nuclear charge, which pulls electrons closer to the nucleus.</li>
<li><strong>Down a Group</strong>: Atomic radius increases as you move down a group because additional electron shells are added, increasing the distance between the nucleus and the outermost electrons.</li>

<hr>
<p>Covalent compounds are formed when atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. Unlike ionic compounds, covalent compounds display distinct physical and chemical properties due to the nature of the bonds between the atoms.</p>
<h2 id="1-low-melting-and-boiling-points">1. <strong>Low Melting and Boiling Points</strong></h2>
<p>Covalent compounds generally have low melting and boiling points compared to ionic compounds. This is because the forces between the molecules (known as intermolecular forces) are weaker than the forces holding ions together in ionic compounds. As a result, covalent compounds are often found in the <strong>liquid</strong> or <strong>gas</strong> state at room temperature.</p>

<h2 id="resting-potential">Resting Potential</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resting Potential</strong>: Neurons maintain a resting potential of about -70mV, with a higher concentration of sodium (Na+) outside the cell and a higher concentration of potassium (K+) inside the cell. This difference is maintained by the sodium-potassium pump.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="generation-of-action-potential">Generation of Action Potential</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stimulus</strong>: A stimulus causes the membrane potential to become less negative, reaching the threshold potential.</li>
<li><strong>Depolarization</strong>: When the threshold is reached, sodium channels open, and sodium ions rush into the neuron, making the inside of the cell more positive.</li>
<li><strong>Repolarization</strong>: After depolarization, potassium channels open, and potassium ions move out, restoring the negative charge inside the cell.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperpolarization</strong>: The membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential before returning to the resting state.</li>

    <h1 id="structure-and-functions-of-the-eye">Structure and Functions of the Eye</h1>
<p>The human eye is a complex organ responsible for the sense of vision. It consists of several components that work together to capture light and convert it into electrical signals that are processed by the brain. Understanding the structure and functions of the eye is essential to grasp how we perceive the world around us.</p>
<p>The main components of the eye include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cornea</strong>: The transparent, dome-shaped outer surface of the eye that refracts light entering the eye.</li>
<li><strong>Pupil</strong>: The circular opening in the center of the iris that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.</li>
<li><strong>Iris</strong>: The colored part of the eye that controls the size of the pupil, thereby adjusting the amount of light that enters the eye.</li>
<li><strong>Lens</strong>: A flexible, transparent structure that focuses light onto the retina.</li>
<li><strong>Retina</strong>: The light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) which detect light and send signals to the brain.</li>
<li><strong>Optic Nerve</strong>: The nerve that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.</li>
<li><strong>Vitreous Body</strong>: The gel-like substance filling the space between the lens and retina, providing shape and support to the eye.</li>
<li><strong>Aqueous Humor</strong>: A fluid that nourishes the cornea and lens, maintaining intraocular pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of vision begins when light enters the eye through the cornea, passes through the pupil, and is refracted by the lens onto the retina. The photoreceptor cells in the retina convert light into electrical impulses, which are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain processes these signals, resulting in the perception of an image.</p>

    <h1 id="photorespiration">Photorespiration</h1>
<p><strong>Photorespiration</strong> is a process that occurs in plants, particularly in <strong>C3 plants</strong>, where oxygen is consumed, and carbon dioxide is released, reducing the efficiency of photosynthesis. It happens when the enzyme <strong>Rubisco</strong>, which normally helps with carbon fixation in the Calvin Cycle, mistakenly attaches oxygen instead of carbon dioxide to a 5-carbon sugar, ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="mechanism-of-photorespiration">Mechanism of Photorespiration</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial Reaction</strong>: Rubisco reacts with O₂ instead of CO₂, leading to the formation of a 5-carbon compound and a 2-carbon compound (phosphoglycolate).</li>
<li><strong>Photorespiratory Pathway</strong>: The 2-carbon compound is broken down in the peroxisomes and mitochondria, releasing CO₂ and consuming energy (ATP and NADPH).</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Carbon</strong>: Photorespiration reduces the overall amount of fixed carbon, thus decreasing the efficiency of photosynthesis.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="factors-affecting-photorespiration">Factors Affecting Photorespiration</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>High Oxygen Concentration</strong>: Photorespiration increases when there is more oxygen available for Rubisco to fix.</li>
<li><strong>High Temperature</strong>: Warmer temperatures favor oxygenation by Rubisco over carboxylation, increasing photorespiration.</li>
<li><strong>Light Intensity</strong>: High light intensity can also increase the rate of photorespiration due to the greater production of oxygen in chloroplasts.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="effects-of-photorespiration-on-plants">Effects of Photorespiration on Plants</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduction in Photosynthesis Efficiency</strong>: Photorespiration reduces the net production of glucose and other sugars by releasing CO₂ without producing ATP or NADPH.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Loss</strong>: The process consumes ATP and NADPH, which are typically used in the Calvin Cycle for producing sugars.</li>
<li><strong>Stress on C3 Plants</strong>: In hot and dry conditions, photorespiration can significantly reduce the productivity of C3 plants because Rubisco favors oxygen fixation over carbon fixation.</li>
</ul>

    <h1 id="frog-reproductive-system-male--female-reproductive-organs">Frog: Reproductive System: Male &amp; Female Reproductive Organs</h1>
<p>The reproductive system of the frog (<em>Rana tigrina</em>) is well-developed for sexual reproduction, involving both <strong>male</strong> and <strong>female</strong> reproductive organs. Frogs exhibit external fertilization, with a distinctive reproductive process during the breeding season.</p>
<h2 id="1-male-reproductive-organs">1. <strong>Male Reproductive Organs</strong></h2>
<p>The male frog&rsquo;s reproductive system is designed to produce sperm and facilitate fertilization.</p>
<h3 id="11-testes">1.1 <strong>Testes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>testes</strong> are the primary male reproductive organs responsible for producing sperm.</li>
<li>Frogs have two <strong>testes</strong>, located in the <strong>abdomen</strong> near the kidneys.</li>
<li>The testes produce sperm during the breeding season, which are then transferred to the <strong>urethra</strong> for further transport.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-vasa-deferentia">1.2 <strong>Vasa Deferentia</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The sperm produced in the testes travel through the <strong>vasa deferentia</strong> (sperm ducts) to the <strong>urogenital duct</strong>.</li>

    <h1 id="frog-respiratory-system-respiratory-organs--physiology-of-respiration">Frog: Respiratory System: Respiratory Organs &amp; Physiology of Respiration</h1>
<p>The <strong>respiratory system</strong> of the frog (<em>Rana tigrina</em>) is highly adapted to its dual life in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Frogs possess specialized <strong>respiratory organs</strong> that enable them to breathe through both their <strong>lungs</strong> and <strong>skin</strong>, depending on the environment and activity level.</p>
<h2 id="1-respiratory-organs-of-the-frog">1. <strong>Respiratory Organs of the Frog</strong></h2>
<p>The frog has <strong>three primary structures</strong> involved in respiration:</p>
<h3 id="11-lungs">1.1 <strong>Lungs</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>lungs</strong> are the main respiratory organs for adult frogs, used primarily for breathing air. These are paired, sac-like structures located in the thoracic cavity.</li>
<li>Frogs inhale air through their nostrils, and the air passes into the <strong>buccal cavity</strong> and then into the lungs.</li>
<li>The <strong>lungs</strong> are relatively simple in structure compared to mammals, consisting of <strong>few alveoli</strong> (air sacs) that allow for gas exchange.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-skin">1.2 <strong>Skin</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Frogs can also <strong>breathe through their skin</strong>, a process known as <strong>cutaneous respiration</strong>. The skin of a frog is highly permeable to gases and water, facilitating the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide directly through the skin.</li>
<li>This type of respiration is particularly important when the frog is underwater, as their lungs are not effective in absorbing oxygen from water.</li>
<li>Skin respiration occurs mainly in aquatic environments, but also when the frog is resting or in a low-activity state on land.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-buccal-cavity">1.3 <strong>Buccal Cavity</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>buccal cavity</strong> (mouth) plays an essential role in <strong>ventilation</strong>, aiding in the movement of air into the lungs.</li>
<li>Frogs perform a process called <strong>buccal pump breathing</strong>, in which they lower and raise the floor of their mouth to force air into the lungs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-physiology-of-respiration-in-frogs">2. <strong>Physiology of Respiration in Frogs</strong></h2>
<p>The frog’s respiration involves a combination of mechanisms for both air and skin breathing.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-acid-rain">What is Acid Rain?</h2>
<p>Acid rain refers to any form of precipitation—such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail—that has a lower pH than normal rainwater, making it more acidic. While normal rain has a pH of about 5.6, acid rain can have a pH as low as 4.0 or even lower. This increased acidity occurs when sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$) and nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}_x$) are released into the atmosphere. These pollutants react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the air to form sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$) and nitric acid ($\text{HNO}_3$). When this acidic precipitation falls to the ground, it can have harmful effects on the environment, human health, and infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Darwinism</strong> refers to the theories of biological evolution developed by <strong>Charles Darwin</strong>, particularly his concept of natural selection. This theory explains how species evolve over time through the differential survival and reproduction of individuals with advantageous traits. Darwin introduced these ideas in his famous book, <strong>&ldquo;On the Origin of Species,&rdquo;</strong> published in 1859. <strong>Neo-Darwinism</strong>, also known as the modern synthesis, incorporates genetics into Darwin’s original ideas, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how evolution occurs. It blends Darwin&rsquo;s principles with discoveries in genetics, emphasizing that evolution is driven by genetic variations in populations.</p>

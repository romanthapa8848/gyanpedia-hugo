<ol>
<li><strong>Stimulus</strong>: A stimulus causes the membrane potential to become less negative, reaching the threshold potential.</li>
<li><strong>Depolarization</strong>: When the threshold is reached, sodium channels open, and sodium ions rush into the neuron, making the inside of the cell more positive.</li>
<li><strong>Repolarization</strong>: After depolarization, potassium channels open, and potassium ions move out, restoring the negative charge inside the cell.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperpolarization</strong>: The membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential before returning to the resting state.</li>

<hr>
<h2 id="1-exchange-of-gases">1. Exchange of Gases</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alveolar Gas Exchange</strong>: The primary function of the alveoli is the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) between the lungs and blood. Oxygen from the air in the alveoli diffuses into the capillaries, while carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses into the alveolar air to be exhaled.</li>
<li><strong>Partial Pressure Gradient</strong>: Gas exchange occurs due to the difference in partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveolar air and the blood.
<ul>
<li>Oxygen moves from areas of higher partial pressure (in the alveoli) to areas of lower partial pressure (in the blood).</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide moves from areas of higher partial pressure (in the blood) to areas of lower partial pressure (in the alveoli).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-transport-of-gases">2. Transport of Gases</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oxygen Transport</strong>: Oxygen is primarily transported in the blood bound to hemoglobin (Hb) in red blood cells. A small amount of oxygen is dissolved directly in the plasma.</li>
<li><strong>Carbon Dioxide Transport</strong>: Carbon dioxide is transported in three forms:
<ul>
<li>Dissolved in plasma (about 7%)</li>
<li>Bound to hemoglobin as carbaminohemoglobin (about 23%)</li>

    <h1 id="structure-and-functions-of-the-eye">Structure and Functions of the Eye</h1>
<p>The human eye is a complex organ responsible for the sense of vision. It consists of several components that work together to capture light and convert it into electrical signals that are processed by the brain. Understanding the structure and functions of the eye is essential to grasp how we perceive the world around us.</p>
<p>The main components of the eye include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cornea</strong>: The transparent, dome-shaped outer surface of the eye that refracts light entering the eye.</li>
<li><strong>Pupil</strong>: The circular opening in the center of the iris that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.</li>
<li><strong>Iris</strong>: The colored part of the eye that controls the size of the pupil, thereby adjusting the amount of light that enters the eye.</li>
<li><strong>Lens</strong>: A flexible, transparent structure that focuses light onto the retina.</li>
<li><strong>Retina</strong>: The light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) which detect light and send signals to the brain.</li>
<li><strong>Optic Nerve</strong>: The nerve that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.</li>
<li><strong>Vitreous Body</strong>: The gel-like substance filling the space between the lens and retina, providing shape and support to the eye.</li>
<li><strong>Aqueous Humor</strong>: A fluid that nourishes the cornea and lens, maintaining intraocular pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of vision begins when light enters the eye through the cornea, passes through the pupil, and is refracted by the lens onto the retina. The photoreceptor cells in the retina convert light into electrical impulses, which are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain processes these signals, resulting in the perception of an image.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="mechanism-of-photorespiration">Mechanism of Photorespiration</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial Reaction</strong>: Rubisco reacts with O₂ instead of CO₂, leading to the formation of a 5-carbon compound and a 2-carbon compound (phosphoglycolate).</li>

These features play vital roles in its movement, feeding, reproduction, and survival. Below is an overview of the key external characteristics of <em>Rana tigrina</em>.</p>
<h3 id="1-body-shape-and-size">1. <strong>Body Shape and Size</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: <em>Rana tigrina</em> is one of the largest frog species in India. It can grow up to 20 cm in length and can weigh up to 0.5 kg, with males being generally smaller than females.</li>
<li><strong>Body Shape</strong>: The body is smooth, muscular, and compact, which helps the frog in jumping and swimming. It has a relatively short body with a flattened, round shape that allows for easier movement in aquatic environments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-skin">2. <strong>Skin</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coloration</strong>: The skin color of <em>Rana tigrina</em> varies, but it is typically green to brown, with darker spots or blotches. This coloration helps it blend into its environment, providing camouflage in the muddy or grassy habitats near water.</li>
<li><strong>Texture</strong>: The skin is smooth and moist, which is essential for cutaneous respiration, where the frog absorbs oxygen through its skin. The moisture also helps to prevent the skin from drying out, especially in terrestrial environments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-limbs">3. <strong>Limbs</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hind Limbs</strong>: The hind limbs are long, muscular, and well-adapted for jumping and swimming. These limbs are used for propulsion in water and for leaping on land. The hind legs have webbed feet, which help the frog swim efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Forelimbs</strong>: The forelimbs are shorter and are used primarily for supporting the body when the frog is resting. The forelimbs are not as muscular as the hind limbs but have well-developed, strong fingers to help the frog grasp and hold onto surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-feet-and-toes">4. <strong>Feet and Toes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webbed Feet</strong>: The hind feet are webbed, aiding in swimming and providing better control in the water. This adaptation is essential for aquatic life.</li>

This positioning allows the frog to keep most of its body submerged while keeping its eyes above water. The eyes have a protective nictitating membrane that helps in keeping the eyes moist and free from debris.</li>
<li><strong>Eyelids</strong>: The frog has three eyelids: the upper, lower, and the nictitating membrane, which protects the eye and assists with moisture retention.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-nostrils-and-mouth">6. <strong>Nostrils and Mouth</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nostrils</strong>: The nostrils are located at the top of the snout and are used for breathing and detecting odors. The position of the nostrils allows the frog to breathe while keeping most of its body submerged underwater.</li>
<li><strong>Mouth</strong>: The mouth is wide and large, allowing the frog to catch and ingest large prey. The lower jaw is slightly wider than the upper jaw, and the mouth is equipped with sharp teeth in the upper jaw to hold onto prey.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-ears-tympanic-membrane">7. <strong>Ears (Tympanic Membrane)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tympanic Membrane</strong>: Located behind the eyes, the tympanic membrane is an external eardrum that helps frogs detect sound. The size of the tympanic membrane is larger in males and is an important characteristic used to differentiate sexes. This structure allows the frog to hear sounds, particularly during the breeding season.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-vocal-sac-in-males">8. <strong>Vocal Sac (In Males)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vocal Sac</strong>: Male frogs have a vocal sac located beneath their throat, which inflates during the breeding season. The vocal sac amplifies the frog&rsquo;s calls, which are used to attract females for mating. This is one of the most noticeable features during the breeding season, as males produce loud, resonating calls.</li>
</ul>

    <h1 id="frog-respiratory-system-respiratory-organs--physiology-of-respiration">Frog: Respiratory System: Respiratory Organs &amp; Physiology of Respiration</h1>
<p>The <strong>respiratory system</strong> of the frog (<em>Rana tigrina</em>) is highly adapted to its dual life in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Frogs possess specialized <strong>respiratory organs</strong> that enable them to breathe through both their <strong>lungs</strong> and <strong>skin</strong>, depending on the environment and activity level.</p>
<h2 id="1-respiratory-organs-of-the-frog">1. <strong>Respiratory Organs of the Frog</strong></h2>
<p>The frog has <strong>three primary structures</strong> involved in respiration:</p>
<h3 id="11-lungs">1.1 <strong>Lungs</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>lungs</strong> are the main respiratory organs for adult frogs, used primarily for breathing air. These are paired, sac-like structures located in the thoracic cavity.</li>
<li>Frogs inhale air through their nostrils, and the air passes into the <strong>buccal cavity</strong> and then into the lungs.</li>
<li>The <strong>lungs</strong> are relatively simple in structure compared to mammals, consisting of <strong>few alveoli</strong> (air sacs) that allow for gas exchange.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-skin">1.2 <strong>Skin</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Frogs can also <strong>breathe through their skin</strong>, a process known as <strong>cutaneous respiration</strong>. The skin of a frog is highly permeable to gases and water, facilitating the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide directly through the skin.</li>
<li>This type of respiration is particularly important when the frog is underwater, as their lungs are not effective in absorbing oxygen from water.</li>
<li>Skin respiration occurs mainly in aquatic environments, but also when the frog is resting or in a low-activity state on land.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-buccal-cavity">1.3 <strong>Buccal Cavity</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>buccal cavity</strong> (mouth) plays an essential role in <strong>ventilation</strong>, aiding in the movement of air into the lungs.</li>
<li>Frogs perform a process called <strong>buccal pump breathing</strong>, in which they lower and raise the floor of their mouth to force air into the lungs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-acid-rain">What is Acid Rain?</h2>
<p>Acid rain refers to any form of precipitation—such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail—that has a lower pH than normal rainwater, making it more acidic. While normal rain has a pH of about 5.6, acid rain can have a pH as low as 4.0 or even lower. This increased acidity occurs when sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$) and nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}_x$) are released into the atmosphere. These pollutants react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the air to form sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$) and nitric acid ($\text{HNO}_3$). When this acidic precipitation falls to the ground, it can have harmful effects on the environment, human health, and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Biological invasion occurs when non-native species, also known as invasive species, are introduced to a new habitat. In these new environments, they establish themselves, spread, and often cause harm to the local ecosystem, economy, or even human health. These invasions can happen due to various human activities, such as trade, travel, and agriculture. For example, when ships transport goods from one country to another, they might unintentionally carry small plants or animals that can thrive in the new location, disrupting the local environment.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Darwinism</strong> refers to the theories of biological evolution developed by <strong>Charles Darwin</strong>, particularly his concept of natural selection. This theory explains how species evolve over time through the differential survival and reproduction of individuals with advantageous traits. Darwin introduced these ideas in his famous book, <strong>&ldquo;On the Origin of Species,&rdquo;</strong> published in 1859. <strong>Neo-Darwinism</strong>, also known as the modern synthesis, incorporates genetics into Darwin’s original ideas, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how evolution occurs. It blends Darwin&rsquo;s principles with discoveries in genetics, emphasizing that evolution is driven by genetic variations in populations.</p>

<p>The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth&rsquo;s surface, making it livable. When sunlight reaches the Earth, some of it is reflected back into space, while the rest is absorbed by the land and oceans, warming the planet. This heat is then radiated back towards space, but certain gases in the atmosphere trap some of this heat, creating a “blanket” around the Earth. This process helps keep our planet warm enough to support life, allowing plants and animals to thrive.</p>

<h2 id="hydrophytes">Hydrophytes</h2>
<p>Hydrophytes (or macrophytes) are plants that live in or around water. They are found in places where the soil remains wet, such as ponds, rivers, lakes, and marshes. Because of their environment, these plants have developed unique features that help them survive in water or very damp conditions.</p>
<h3 id="key-features">Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft and flexible stems</strong>: Hydrophytes usually have soft, flexible stems. This allows the plants to bend and move easily with the flow of water, preventing them from breaking.</li>
<li><strong>Air-filled spaces</strong>: Many hydrophytes have hollow spaces inside their stems and leaves that are filled with air. This helps the plants float on water, making it easier for them to get sunlight for photosynthesis.</li>
<li><strong>Shallow and spreading roots</strong>: Since they grow in water or wet soil, hydrophytes don’t need deep roots to find moisture. Instead, their roots are often shallow but spread out wide to absorb nutrients from the surrounding water.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-hydrophytes">Types of Hydrophytes:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Floating hydrophytes</strong>: Plants like water hyacinth and duckweed float freely on the surface of water.</li>
<li><strong>Submerged hydrophytes</strong>: These are plants that grow entirely underwater, like hydrilla and elodea.</li>
<li><strong>Emergent hydrophytes</strong>: These plants have roots in the water, but parts like leaves and flowers grow above the water surface. Examples include cattails and lotus.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="examples-of-hydrophytes">Examples of Hydrophytes:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water lily (Nymphaea)</strong>: A floating hydrophyte that grows in ponds and lakes.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata)</strong>: A submerged plant commonly found in freshwater bodies.</li>
<li><strong>Cattail (Typha)</strong>: An emergent plant found in wetlands and marshes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="applications">Applications:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water purification</strong>: Some hydrophytes, such as water hyacinth, are used to clean and filter water in ponds and wetlands.</li>
<li><strong>Erosion control</strong>: Hydrophytes, like reeds and cattails, help prevent soil erosion in wetland areas by stabilizing the soil with their roots.</li>
<li><strong>Aquatic gardening</strong>: Many hydrophytes, like lotus and water lilies, are popular choices for decorating ponds and water gardens.</li>

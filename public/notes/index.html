    <h1 id="acid-rain">Acid Rain</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-acid-rain">What is Acid Rain?</h2>
<p>Acid rain refers to any form of precipitation—such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail—that has a lower pH than normal rainwater, making it more acidic. While normal rain has a pH of about 5.6, acid rain can have a pH as low as 4.0 or even lower. This increased acidity occurs when sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$) and nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}_x$) are released into the atmosphere. These pollutants react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the air to form sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$) and nitric acid ($\text{HNO}_3$). When this acidic precipitation falls to the ground, it can have harmful effects on the environment, human health, and infrastructure.</p>

    <h1 id="biological-invasion">Biological Invasion</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-biological-invasion">What is Biological Invasion?</h2>
<p>Biological invasion occurs when non-native species, also known as invasive species, are introduced to a new habitat. In these new environments, they establish themselves, spread, and often cause harm to the local ecosystem, economy, or even human health. These invasions can happen due to various human activities, such as trade, travel, and agriculture. For example, when ships transport goods from one country to another, they might unintentionally carry small plants or animals that can thrive in the new location, disrupting the local environment.</p>

    <h1 id="darwinism--concept-of-neo-darwinism">Darwinism &amp; Concept of Neo-Darwinism</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Darwinism</strong> refers to the theories of biological evolution developed by <strong>Charles Darwin</strong>, particularly his concept of natural selection. This theory explains how species evolve over time through the differential survival and reproduction of individuals with advantageous traits. Darwin introduced these ideas in his famous book, <strong>&ldquo;On the Origin of Species,&rdquo;</strong> published in 1859. <strong>Neo-Darwinism</strong>, also known as the modern synthesis, incorporates genetics into Darwin’s original ideas, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how evolution occurs. It blends Darwin&rsquo;s principles with discoveries in genetics, emphasizing that evolution is driven by genetic variations in populations.</p>

    <h1 id="depletion-of-ozone-layer">Depletion of Ozone Layer</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-the-ozone-layer">What is the Ozone Layer?</h2>
<p>The ozone layer is a region of Earth&rsquo;s stratosphere that contains a high concentration of ozone ($\text{O}_3$) molecules. It is located about 10 to 30 miles above the Earth&rsquo;s surface. The ozone layer plays a crucial role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing most of the Sun&rsquo;s harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

    <h1 id="types-properties-and-uses-of-lime">Types, Properties, and Uses of Lime</h1>
<p>Lime is an essential material in construction and various industries due to its versatility and beneficial properties. This document outlines the different types of lime, their properties, and their applications.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-types-of-lime">1. Types of Lime</h2>
<p>Lime can be classified into several categories based on its production process and chemical composition:</p>
<h3 id="a-quicklime-calcium-oxide">a. Quicklime (Calcium Oxide)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Quicklime is produced by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) in a kiln to high temperatures (around 900°C to 1,000°C), resulting in a white, powdery substance.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Formula:</strong> $CaO$</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Highly reactive; generates heat when mixed with water, leading to a significant increase in temperature.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-hydrated-lime-calcium-hydroxide">b. Hydrated Lime (Calcium Hydroxide)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Hydrated lime is created by adding water to quicklime. This process results in a fine powder that is less reactive than quicklime.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Formula:</strong> $Ca(OH)_2$</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> It is safe to handle and is commonly used in various applications, including soil stabilization and as a binding agent in mortars.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-agricultural-lime-calcium-carbonate">c. Agricultural Lime (Calcium Carbonate)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> This form of lime is essentially ground limestone, used primarily to improve soil quality and pH balance in agricultural applications.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Formula:</strong> $CaCO_3$</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Less reactive compared to quicklime and hydrated lime, making it suitable for use in soil amendment.</li>

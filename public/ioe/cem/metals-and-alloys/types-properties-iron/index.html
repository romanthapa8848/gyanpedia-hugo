<h2 id="1-types-of-iron">1. Types of Iron</h2>
<h3 id="a-cast-iron">a. Cast Iron</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2%. It is produced by melting iron and pouring it into molds.</li>
<li><strong>Types of Cast Iron:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gray Cast Iron:</strong> Contains graphite flakes, which provide good machinability and wear resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Ductile Cast Iron (Nodular Cast Iron):</strong> Contains spherical graphite, offering higher strength and ductility.</li>
<li><strong>White Cast Iron:</strong> Has a white, hard surface and is used for wear-resistant applications.</li>
<li><strong>Malleable Cast Iron:</strong> Produced by heat treating white cast iron, providing better ductility and toughness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-wrought-iron">b. Wrought Iron</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Wrought iron is a type of iron that is characterized by its low carbon content (less than 0.08%) and is known for its malleability and ductility. It is produced by heating and hammering iron to shape it.</li>
<li><strong>Properties:</strong> Wrought iron is resistant to corrosion and can be easily welded, making it suitable for decorative applications and structural components.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-steel">c. Steel</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> While technically an alloy of iron with carbon, steel is often discussed in conjunction with iron. It has a carbon content between 0.02% and 2.1% and exhibits a range of properties depending on the specific alloying elements used.</li>
<li><strong>Types of Steel:</strong> Includes carbon steel, alloy steel, and stainless steel, each with unique properties and applications.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-properties-of-iron">2. Properties of Iron</h2>
<h3 id="a-mechanical-properties">a. Mechanical Properties</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strength:</strong> Iron has high tensile strength, making it suitable for load-bearing applications.</li>
<li><strong>Ductility:</strong> Iron can be drawn into wires or shaped without breaking, particularly in its wrought form.</li>
<li><strong>Malleability:</strong> Iron can be hammered or pressed into various shapes, especially in its wrought form.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-physical-properties">b. Physical Properties</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Density:</strong> Iron has a high density (approximately 7.87 g/cm³), contributing to its strength.</li>
<li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Iron has a melting point of about 1538°C (2800°F), making it suitable for high-temperature applications.</li>
<li><strong>Magnetism:</strong> Iron is ferromagnetic, meaning it can be magnetized and is attracted to magnets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-chemical-properties">c. Chemical Properties</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reactivity:</strong> Iron reacts with oxygen in the presence of moisture to form iron oxide (rust), leading to corrosion.</li>
<li><strong>Alloying:</strong> Iron can be alloyed with various elements to enhance its properties, such as increasing strength or improving corrosion resistance.</li>
</ul>

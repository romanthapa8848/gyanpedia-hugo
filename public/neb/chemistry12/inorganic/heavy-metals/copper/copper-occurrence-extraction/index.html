<p>Copper is a valuable metal that occurs in nature in various mineral forms. One of the primary ores of copper is <strong>copper pyrite</strong> (also known as <strong>chalcopyrite</strong>, $\ce{CuFeS_2}$), a copper iron sulfide mineral. This ore is widely used for the extraction of copper due to its relatively high copper content.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="occurrence-of-copper">Occurrence of Copper</h2>
<p>Copper is found in various forms in nature, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Copper Pyrite ($\ce{CuFeS_2}$):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Copper pyrite is the most important and abundant ore of copper, comprising about 80% of the world&rsquo;s copper ore.</li>
<li>It is often found in large deposits, especially in countries like Chile, Canada, and the United States.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copper Carbonates (e.g., Malachite $\ce{CuCO_3.Cu(OH)_2}$):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These are secondary copper ores found in regions with a more oxidizing environment.</li>
<li>They are often more easily processed but less abundant compared to copper pyrite.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Native Copper:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In rare instances, copper occurs in its pure metallic form as native copper, although this is relatively uncommon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="extraction-of-copper-from-copper-pyrite">Extraction of Copper from Copper Pyrite</h2>
<p>The extraction of copper from copper pyrite is a complex process that involves multiple stages, primarily through <strong>pyrometallurgical</strong> and <strong>hydrometallurgical</strong> methods.</p>
<h3 id="1-concentration-of-the-ore-froth-flotation">1. <strong>Concentration of the Ore (Froth Flotation)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The first step in the extraction process is to concentrate the copper pyrite ore. This is done through <strong>froth flotation</strong>, a process in which the ore is crushed and mixed with water and chemicals that make the copper minerals hydrophobic.</li>
<li>The hydrophobic copper minerals are then separated from the waste material (gangue) by flotation, producing a concentrate that contains a higher percentage of copper.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-roasting-of-the-concentrate">2. <strong>Roasting of the Concentrate</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The concentrated copper pyrite is heated in the presence of oxygen (roasting) at temperatures around 600-700°C.</li>
<li>The roasting process results in the following chemical reactions:
$$ \ce{2CuFeS_2 + 3O_2 -> 2CuS + 2SO_2} $$<br>
$$ \ce{CuS + O_2 -> CuO + SO_2} $$</li>
<li>This reaction forms <strong>copper(I) sulfide (CuS)</strong> and sulfur dioxide gas (<strong>SO2</strong>), which is released into the atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-reduction-of-copperi-sulfide-to-copper-metal">3. <strong>Reduction of Copper(I) Sulfide to Copper Metal</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The copper(I) sulfide formed during roasting is then treated with more oxygen or other reducing agents to convert it into copper metal. The reduction process is carried out in a blast furnace, where the copper(I) sulfide is heated with carbon (coke).</li>
<li>The reduction reaction is:
$$ \ce{Cu_2S + O_2 -> 2Cu + SO_2} $$
<ul>
<li>This reaction produces <strong>copper metal</strong> and sulfur dioxide gas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-purification-of-copper-electrolytic-refining">4. <strong>Purification of Copper (Electrolytic Refining)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The copper obtained from the reduction process is not pure and contains impurities such as iron, sulfur, and other metals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The impure copper is purified through <strong>electrolytic refining</strong>. In this process, the impure copper is made the anode in an electrolytic cell, and a pure copper cathode is placed in the cell. A copper sulfate solution is used as the electrolyte.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The copper from the anode dissolves and is deposited on the cathode as pure copper, while the impurities either remain in the solution or are left behind at the bottom of the cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reactions occurring during electrolytic refining are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>At the Anode:</strong>
$$ \ce{Cu (s) -> Cu^{2+} (aq) + 2e^-} $$</li>
<li><strong>At the Cathode:</strong>
$$ \ce{Cu^{2+} (aq) + 2e^- -> Cu (s)} $$</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Copper is primarily extracted from <strong>copper pyrite</strong> (chalcopyrite), which is concentrated and roasted to form copper sulfide. The copper sulfide is then reduced to copper metal, followed by purification through electrolytic refining to obtain pure copper. The extraction process involves complex steps such as froth flotation, roasting, reduction, and electrolytic refining.</p>

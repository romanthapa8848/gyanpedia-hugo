<p><strong>Mercury</strong> is a toxic heavy metal that occurs naturally in the earth&rsquo;s crust. It is most commonly found in nature as <strong>cinnabar</strong> ($\ce{HgS}$), which is the primary ore from which mercury is extracted.</p>
<h2 id="occurrence-of-mercury">Occurrence of Mercury</h2>
<p>Mercury is found in the form of <strong>cinnabar</strong> ($\ce{HgS}$), a red-colored mineral, which is the most common ore of mercury. Cinnabar deposits are typically found in areas with volcanic activity or in sedimentary rocks. These deposits can be found in countries such as Spain, Italy, and China, where large reserves of cinnabar are mined for mercury extraction.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinnabar</strong> is primarily composed of mercury sulfide ($\ce{HgS}$).</li>
<li>Mercury can also occur in trace amounts in other minerals like <strong>livingstonite</strong> ($\ce{HgSb_2S_4}$) and <strong>montroydite</strong> ($\ce{HgO}$).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="extraction-of-mercury-from-cinnabar">Extraction of Mercury from Cinnabar</h2>
<p>Mercury is extracted from cinnabar by heating it in a <strong>roasting</strong> process, where the cinnabar is heated to a high temperature, and mercury vapor is released, leaving sulfur behind.</p>
<h3 id="steps-in-extraction">Steps in Extraction:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Roasting of Cinnabar</strong>:
Cinnabar ($\ce{HgS}$) is heated in a furnace with excess air. The heat causes the cinnabar to decompose into mercury vapor and sulfur dioxide ($\ce{SO_2}$):
</p>
$$
   \ce{HgS (s) -> Hg (l) + SO_2 (g)}
   $$</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Condensation of Mercury Vapor</strong>:
The mercury vapor ($\ce{Hg}$) is then condensed in a cooler part of the furnace or a separate condensation chamber to obtain liquid mercury (also known as <strong>quicksilver</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sulfur Dioxide Removal</strong>:
The sulfur dioxide gas ($\ce{SO_2}$) is usually treated or neutralized before being released into the atmosphere, as it is a toxic and harmful gas. Sometimes, $\ce{SO_2}$ is used in the production of sulfuric acid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Purification</strong>:
The obtained liquid mercury is often purified by distillation or other chemical processes to remove impurities like excess sulfur or other metals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="properties-of-mercury">Properties of Mercury</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong>: Mercury is a <strong>silver-white, metallic liquid</strong> at room temperature, known for its <strong>high density</strong> and <strong>high surface tension</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Toxicity</strong>: Mercury is highly toxic, and both inhalation of its vapor and ingestion can lead to serious health issues.</li>
<li><strong>Volatility</strong>: Mercury vaporizes at room temperature, which is why it is essential to handle mercury with care.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uses-of-mercury">Uses of Mercury</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>In Thermometers</strong>: Mercury is commonly used in thermometers due to its wide liquid range and thermal expansion properties.</li>
<li><strong>In Barometers</strong>: Mercury is also used in barometers to measure atmospheric pressure.</li>
<li><strong>In Electrical Devices</strong>: Mercury is used in electrical switches and relays.</li>
<li><strong>In Mining</strong>: Mercury is historically used to extract gold and silver from their ores by amalgamation.</li>
<li><strong>In Medicine</strong>: Mercury compounds have been used in some pharmaceutical products, though their use has become less common due to toxicity concerns.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Mercury is commonly found in nature as cinnabar ($\ce{HgS}$), from which it is extracted by heating the ore to release mercury vapor. This vapor is then condensed to form liquid mercury, which is used in a variety of applications, including thermometers, barometers, and electrical devices. Due to its toxicity, careful handling is required during extraction and use.</p>

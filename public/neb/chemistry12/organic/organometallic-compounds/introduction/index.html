<p>Organometallic compounds are compounds containing a metal-carbon bond, where the metal is usually a transition metal or an alkali/alkaline earth metal. These compounds have significant roles in organic synthesis, catalysis, and various chemical reactions. This section focuses on three important types of organometallic compounds: organolithium, organocopper, and organocadmium compounds.</p>
<h2 id="1-organolithium-compounds">1. Organolithium Compounds</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Organolithium compounds are one of the most important classes of organometallic compounds, where a carbon atom is bonded to a lithium atom. These compounds are highly reactive and are widely used in organic synthesis, particularly in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds.</p>
<h3 id="general-formula">General Formula</h3>
<p>The general formula for organolithium compounds is:</p>
$$\ce{R-Li}$$<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\ce{R}$ is an alkyl, aryl, or vinyl group,</li>
<li>$\ce{Li}$ represents the lithium atom.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples-of-organolithium-compounds">Examples of Organolithium Compounds</h3>

<h2 id="2-organocopper-compounds">2. Organocopper Compounds</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
<p>Organocopper compounds, often referred to as Gilman reagents, are a class of organometallic compounds containing copper-carbon bonds. These compounds are less reactive than organolithium compounds but still serve as excellent nucleophiles in organic reactions.</p>
<h3 id="general-formula-1">General Formula</h3>
<p>The general formula for organocopper compounds is:</p>
$$\ce{R2CuLi}$$<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\ce{R}$ is an alkyl or aryl group,</li>
<li>$\ce{Cu}$ represents the copper atom,</li>
<li>$\ce{Li}$ is the lithium atom that stabilizes the compound.</li>

</ul>
<p>These compounds are widely used in coupling reactions, such as the <strong>Gilman reaction</strong>, and can be used for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds.</p>
<h2 id="3-organocadmium-compounds">3. Organocadmium Compounds</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-2">Introduction</h3>
<p>Organocadmium compounds are organometallic compounds in which cadmium is bonded to a carbon atom. These compounds are relatively less studied compared to organolithium and organocopper compounds but are valuable in organic synthesis due to their unique reactivity.</p>
<h3 id="general-formula-2">General Formula</h3>
<p>The general formula for organocadmium compounds is:</p>
$$\ce{R2Cd}$$<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\ce{R}$ is an alkyl or aryl group,</li>
<li>$\ce{Cd}$ represents the cadmium atom.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples-of-organocadmium-compounds">Examples of Organocadmium Compounds</h3>

<li><strong>Diethylcadmium ($\ce{(C2H5)2Cd}$)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Phenylcadmium ($\ce{C6H5Cd}$)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These compounds are used in reactions similar to those of organocopper compounds, such as nucleophilic substitution and coupling reactions.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Organometallic compounds such as organolithium, organocopper, and organocadmium play a crucial role in organic chemistry, especially in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Organolithium compounds are highly reactive and are widely used in various organic reactions. Organocopper compounds, often used as Gilman reagents, are useful in coupling reactions. Organocadmium compounds, while less studied, are valuable for specific organic synthesis processes. The general formulas for these compounds are $\ce{R-Li}$, $\ce{R2CuLi}$, and $\ce{R2Cd}$, respectively.</p>

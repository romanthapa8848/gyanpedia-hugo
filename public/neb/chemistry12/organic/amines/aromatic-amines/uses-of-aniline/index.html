  <div class="math-content"><h1 id="uses-of-aniline">Uses of Aniline</h1>
<p>Aniline ($\ce{C6H5NH2}$), a versatile organic compound, has numerous applications in industries ranging from textiles to pharmaceuticals. Its unique properties, especially the presence of the amino group ($\ce{NH2}$), make it highly reactive and useful for synthesizing a wide variety of products.</p>
<h2 id="1-production-of-dyes">1. Production of Dyes</h2>
<p>Aniline is primarily used in the manufacturing of dyes, particularly azo dyes. These dyes are used extensively in the textile industry to color fabrics. Aniline reacts with diazonium salts in coupling reactions to form azo compounds, which are vibrant and stable dyes. Azo dyes derived from aniline are widely used in the production of synthetic dyes for clothing, food coloring, and industrial applications.</p>
<h2 id="2-pharmaceutical-industry">2. Pharmaceutical Industry</h2>
<p>Aniline is an important intermediate in the production of various pharmaceutical compounds. It is used to synthesize drugs like paracetamol (acetaminophen), an analgesic and antipyretic. Aniline derivatives are also involved in the synthesis of various other drugs, including local anesthetics, antibiotics, and antiseptics.</p>
<h2 id="3-manufacture-of-polyurethanes">3. Manufacture of Polyurethanes</h2>
<p>Aniline is used in the production of polyurethane foams and elastomers. Polyurethanes are widely used in the manufacture of flexible foams, insulation materials, synthetic leathers, and coatings. The chemical properties of aniline allow it to be a valuable component in these polymerization processes.</p>

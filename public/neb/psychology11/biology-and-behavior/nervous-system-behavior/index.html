<p>The nervous system is the body&rsquo;s communication network that controls all bodily functions, from basic reflexes to complex behaviors. It is divided into two major parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Together, these systems allow the body to respond to internal and external stimuli, enabling behavior.</p>
<h3 id="central-nervous-system-cns">Central Nervous System (CNS)</h3>
<p>The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. It acts as the main control center of the body, processing sensory information, making decisions, and sending signals to different parts of the body.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Brain</strong>: The brain is the control center for thought, memory, emotion, and sensory processing. It has several parts, each with specific functions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cerebrum</strong>: Responsible for higher brain functions, including sensory processing, reasoning, planning, and voluntary movement.</li>
<li><strong>Cerebellum</strong>: Coordinates movement, balance, and posture.</li>
<li><strong>Brainstem</strong>: Controls basic life functions such as heart rate, breathing, and sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Illustration of the Brain</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The brain is divided into two hemispheres (left and right), each responsible for different functions. The left hemisphere controls the right side of the body and is involved in language and logic. The right hemisphere controls the left side and is linked to creativity and spatial abilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spinal Cord</strong>: The spinal cord is a long, tubular structure that runs from the brainstem down the back. It serves as the main communication link between the brain and the rest of the body. It transmits sensory information to the brain and motor commands from the brain to the muscles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="peripheral-nervous-system-pns">Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)</h3>
<p>The peripheral nervous system consists of nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. It connects the central nervous system to the limbs and organs, enabling communication between the body and the CNS.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Somatic Nervous System</strong>: Controls voluntary movements and transmits sensory information from the skin, muscles, and joints to the CNS.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomic Nervous System</strong>: Regulates involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and respiration. It is divided into two parts:
<ul>
<li><strong>Sympathetic Nervous System</strong>: Activates the body in response to stress (&ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo;).</li>
<li><strong>Parasympathetic Nervous System</strong>: Calms the body after stress (&ldquo;rest and digest&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-points">Key Points:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord, which control all body functions.</li>
<li>The brain consists of several parts, each responsible for different cognitive and motor functions.</li>
<li>The spinal cord transmits signals between the brain and the body.</li>
<li>The peripheral nervous system connects the CNS to the rest of the body, allowing for sensory and motor communication.</li>
<li>The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary processes, while the somatic system controls voluntary actions.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The nervous system is vital for behavior, controlling both voluntary and involuntary functions. The CNS, including the brain and spinal cord, serves as the control center, while the PNS connects the CNS to the body. The brain&rsquo;s various regions and the spinal cord coordinate bodily functions and responses, influencing behavior.</p>

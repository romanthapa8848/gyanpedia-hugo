<p>The <strong>classroom climate</strong> refers to the overall atmosphere in a classroom that influences student learning, behavior, and interaction. It encompasses physical, social, and emotional aspects of the learning environment. An effective classroom climate is essential for fostering engagement, motivation, and academic success. Enhancing classroom climate involves creating an environment that is positive, inclusive, respectful, and conducive to learning.</p>
<h2 id="key-elements-of-classroom-climate">Key Elements of Classroom Climate</h2>

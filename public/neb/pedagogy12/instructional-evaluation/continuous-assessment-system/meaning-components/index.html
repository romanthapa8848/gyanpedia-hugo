         <h1 id="meaning-and-components-of-cas">Meaning and Components of CAS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Continuous Assessment System (CAS)</strong> is an approach to evaluating students&rsquo; learning progress through regular and systematic assessments over a period of time. Unlike traditional testing methods that rely on one-time exams, CAS focuses on ongoing evaluation, enabling teachers to monitor students’ performance continuously. This method provides a more comprehensive and holistic view of a student&rsquo;s abilities and learning journey.</p>
<p>CAS is designed to assess not just academic knowledge but also a student’s skills, behavior, and overall development. By using a variety of assessment methods such as projects, assignments, quizzes, and observations, CAS ensures that students are evaluated on multiple aspects of learning, including cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains.</p>
<h3 id="components-of-cas">Components of CAS</h3>
<p>The main components of the Continuous Assessment System include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Formative Assessments</strong>:<br>
These are assessments conducted during the learning process to monitor students’ understanding and provide feedback for improvement. Examples include quizzes, short assignments, class participation, and group work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Summative Assessments</strong>:<br>
These are periodic evaluations used to measure the overall achievement of students at the end of a term or unit. They often include final exams, project presentations, or end-of-term tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong>:<br>
Continuous and timely feedback is a core element of CAS. It helps students understand their strengths and areas for improvement, guiding them to improve their performance in future assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peer and Self-Assessment</strong>:<br>
In CAS, students are encouraged to assess their own work and the work of their peers. This not only enhances their critical thinking but also promotes responsibility and active learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Observation and Documentation</strong>:<br>
Teachers observe and document students&rsquo; behavior, progress, and skills throughout the learning process. This could include monitoring group discussions, teamwork, class participation, and other non-academic areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Portfolios</strong>:<br>
Students maintain a collection of their work over time in a portfolio. This could include drafts, completed projects, reflections, and other items that demonstrate their learning and development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diverse Assessment Methods</strong>:<br>
CAS includes a variety of assessment tools such as oral presentations, projects, case studies, and practical work that assess different aspects of student learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility and Adaptability</strong>:<br>
The CAS approach allows teachers to modify their assessment strategies based on the progress and needs of individual students. This helps cater to diverse learning styles and provides a more personalized evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In traditional education systems, textbooks have been the primary source of information for teaching and learning. However, teaching solely by textbooks often limits the scope of learning and may fail to address the diverse needs and learning styles of students. The curriculum, on the other hand, is a comprehensive guide that outlines the educational goals, content, and learning outcomes for a subject or course. Teaching by curriculum focuses on achieving the broader educational objectives, allowing for flexibility, creativity, and more effective learning experiences.</p>
<p>The shift from textbook-based teaching to curriculum-based teaching emphasizes the importance of developing students&rsquo; critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and practical knowledge, beyond just memorizing content from textbooks. By integrating the curriculum with various resources, activities, and real-world examples, educators can provide students with a more holistic and engaging learning experience.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

It encourages the development of critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity. Teachers who focus on curriculum-based teaching can adapt to different student needs, promote deeper understanding, and use various methods to engage students in the learning process.</p>

<p>In the context of Nepal, the <strong>Play Method</strong> and <strong>Storytelling</strong> are two powerful tools in implementing the <strong>Child-Centered Learning</strong> approach, particularly in early childhood education. These methods align with the principles of active learning, making education more engaging, relevant, and accessible for young learners.</p>
<h3 id="1-play-method-in-child-centered-learning">1. <strong>Play Method in Child-Centered Learning</strong></h3>

<li><strong>Promotes Cognitive Growth</strong>: Play stimulates critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-storytelling-as-a-tool-for-learning">2. <strong>Storytelling as a Tool for Learning</strong></h3>

<li><strong>Teacher Training</strong>: Teachers may not always have the skills or understanding to integrate these methods into their teaching practices.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Barriers</strong>: In some areas, there may be resistance to new teaching methods due to traditional views on education.</li>

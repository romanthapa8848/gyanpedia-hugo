<p>Human development is a continuous process that involves various stages, each marked by specific physical, cognitive, and emotional milestones. These stages are often divided into different life periods, each with unique challenges and growth opportunities. Understanding these stages is essential for supporting individuals at each phase of their life.</p>
<p>The key stages of human development include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Infancy (0-2 years)</strong>: The first stage of development where physical growth is rapid. Infants develop basic motor skills, and early cognitive abilities begin to emerge. Emotional bonding with caregivers also begins during this period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Early Childhood (2-6 years)</strong>: This stage is characterized by the development of language, fine and gross motor skills, and increased social interaction. Children start to develop self-awareness and basic emotional regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Middle Childhood (6-12 years)</strong>: In this stage, cognitive abilities advance, and children become capable of more complex thought processes. They also become more independent and develop social relationships outside the family, including peer interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adolescence (12-18 years)</strong>: Adolescents undergo significant physical changes, including puberty. Cognitive abilities continue to improve, and emotional growth is focused on identity formation. Peer relationships become increasingly important, and the quest for independence grows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adulthood</strong>: Adulthood is divided into early, middle, and late adulthood, each with distinct characteristics. Early adulthood focuses on career and relationship development, while middle adulthood involves reflections on life achievements. Late adulthood typically involves changes related to physical health and the redefinition of roles in society.</p>
</li>
</ol>

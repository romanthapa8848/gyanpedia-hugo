         <h1 id="sex-linked-inheritance-color-blindness-in-man-and-eye-color-of-drosophila">Sex-Linked Inheritance (Color Blindness in Man and Eye Color of Drosophila)</h1>
<p><strong>Sex-linked inheritance</strong> refers to the inheritance of genes that are located on the sex chromosomes (X and Y chromosomes). Since males and females differ in their sex chromosome composition, sex-linked traits show different inheritance patterns in males and females. These traits are often associated with the X chromosome, as the Y chromosome contains fewer genes related to non-sexual traits.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="x-linked-inheritance">X-linked Inheritance</h2>
<p>In most cases, sex-linked traits are <strong>X-linked</strong>, meaning they are carried on the <strong>X chromosome</strong>. Since males have only one X chromosome (XY), they express all X-linked traits, whether dominant or recessive. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), so they require two copies of a recessive allele to express a recessive trait.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics-of-x-linked-inheritance">Characteristics of X-linked Inheritance:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Males are more likely to express X-linked recessive traits because they only have one X chromosome.</li>
<li>Females are less likely to express X-linked recessive traits unless they inherit the recessive allele from both parents.</li>
<li>The trait is passed from affected mothers to sons, but fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons (since sons inherit their father&rsquo;s Y chromosome).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="examples-of-sex-linked-inheritance">Examples of Sex-Linked Inheritance</h2>
<h3 id="1-color-blindness-in-humans">1. <strong>Color Blindness in Humans</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Color blindness</strong> is a common X-linked recessive trait, primarily affecting males. Individuals with color blindness have difficulty distinguishing certain colors, especially red and green.</p>
<h4 id="inheritance-pattern">Inheritance Pattern:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Males</strong> inherit their X chromosome from their mother and their Y chromosome from their father. If a male inherits an X chromosome with the color blindness allele, he will express the condition because he has no second X chromosome to counter the effect.</li>
<li><strong>Females</strong> need to inherit two copies of the color blindness allele (one from each parent) to express the trait. If a female inherits only one allele, she becomes a carrier but does not show symptoms of color blindness.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example-cross">Example Cross:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mother</strong> (XᴄXᴄ) × <strong>Father</strong> (XY)</li>
<li>The offspring would have the following genotypes:
<ul>
<li>Sons: XᴄY (color blind)</li>
<li>Daughters: XᴄX (carriers, not color blind)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-eye-color-in-drosophila">2. <strong>Eye Color in Drosophila</strong></h3>
<p>The inheritance of <strong>eye color in Drosophila</strong> is another well-known example of sex-linked inheritance. The <strong>red eye color</strong> is dominant, while the <strong>white eye color</strong> is recessive. The gene for eye color is located on the X chromosome in Drosophila.</p>
<h4 id="inheritance-pattern-1">Inheritance Pattern:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Males</strong> inherit their eye color gene from their mother. Since males have only one X chromosome, if they inherit an X chromosome with the white eye allele, they will show white eyes.</li>
<li><strong>Females</strong> need two copies of the white eye allele (one from each parent) to express the white eye color. If they inherit only one white allele, they will have red eyes and be carriers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example-cross-1">Example Cross:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mother</strong> (XᴡXᴄ) × <strong>Father</strong> (XᴄY)</li>
<li>The offspring would have the following genotypes:
<ul>
<li>Sons: XᴄY (red eyes)</li>
<li>Daughters: XᴡXᴄ (red eyes, carrier)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Sex-linked inheritance is a genetic phenomenon where traits are associated with genes located on the sex chromosomes. Most often, these genes are X-linked. <strong>Color blindness in humans</strong> and <strong>eye color in Drosophila</strong> are classic examples of X-linked inheritance. Males, having only one X chromosome, are more likely to express X-linked recessive traits like color blindness, while females need two copies of the recessive allele to express the trait.</p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<h3 id="1-what-is-sex-linked-inheritance">1. What is sex-linked inheritance?</h3>
<p>Sex-linked inheritance refers to the inheritance of traits that are determined by genes located on the sex chromosomes (X or Y).</p>
<h3 id="2-what-is-the-difference-between-x-linked-and-y-linked-inheritance">2. What is the difference between X-linked and Y-linked inheritance?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-linked inheritance</strong> involves traits located on the X chromosome, while <strong>Y-linked inheritance</strong> involves traits located on the Y chromosome.</li>
<li>X-linked traits are more common, and males are more likely to express X-linked recessive traits.</li>
<li>Y-linked traits are only passed from father to son.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-why-are-males-more-likely-to-express-x-linked-recessive-traits">3. Why are males more likely to express X-linked recessive traits?</h3>
<p>Males only have one X chromosome, so they will express any X-linked recessive traits that are present on that X. Females, on the other hand, need two copies of the recessive allele to express the trait.</p>
<h3 id="4-what-is-color-blindness-and-how-is-it-inherited">4. What is color blindness and how is it inherited?</h3>
<p>Color blindness is a recessive X-linked trait that causes difficulty distinguishing between colors, particularly red and green. It is inherited from the mother, and males are more likely to express the trait because they only have one X chromosome.</p>
<h3 id="5-what-is-the-inheritance-pattern-of-eye-color-in-drosophila">5. What is the inheritance pattern of eye color in Drosophila?</h3>
<p>Eye color in Drosophila is determined by an X-linked gene. Red eyes are dominant, and white eyes are recessive. Males inherit their eye color gene from their mother, while females need two copies of the recessive allele to have white eyes.</p>
<h3 id="6-can-females-be-carriers-of-sex-linked-traits">6. Can females be carriers of sex-linked traits?</h3>
<p>Yes, females can be carriers of X-linked recessive traits if they inherit one recessive allele. These females do not express the trait but can pass the allele to their offspring.</p>

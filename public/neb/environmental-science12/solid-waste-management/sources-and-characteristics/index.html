<h2 id="2-characteristics-of-solid-waste">2. Characteristics of Solid Waste</h2>
<p>The characteristics of solid waste vary depending on the source and composition. The key characteristics include:</p>
<h3 id="21-physical-characteristics">2.1 Physical Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size and Shape</strong>: Waste can vary from small particles to large items (e.g., furniture, construction debris).</li>
<li><strong>Density</strong>: Waste density varies from light (e.g., plastic) to heavy (e.g., metal and glass).</li>
<li><strong>Moisture Content</strong>: Wet waste, such as food scraps, contributes significantly to the weight and volume of solid waste.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="22-chemical-characteristics">2.2 Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organic and Inorganic Composition</strong>: Solid waste contains both organic (e.g., food scraps, yard waste) and inorganic (e.g., metals, plastics) materials.</li>
<li><strong>Toxicity</strong>: Certain wastes, especially hazardous waste, contain harmful chemicals and heavy metals (e.g., mercury in batteries, lead in e-waste).</li>
<li><strong>Flammability</strong>: Some solid waste, like paper, plastics, and certain chemicals, is highly flammable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="23-biological-characteristics">2.3 Biological Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decomposability</strong>: Organic waste, such as food scraps, decomposes over time through biological processes.</li>
<li><strong>Pathogens</strong>: Biomedical and some industrial waste can contain harmful bacteria and viruses, posing health risks.</li>
<li><strong>Nutrient Content</strong>: Organic waste like food scraps and manure can be rich in nutrients and are often used in composting for agricultural purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="24-toxicity-and-hazardous-materials">2.4 Toxicity and Hazardous Materials</h3>
<p>Certain solid waste streams, like e-waste, industrial waste, and medical waste, contain toxic substances that can have long-term environmental and health impacts.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Solid waste originates from various human activities, with sources ranging from residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, to hazardous sectors. Each waste type has unique characteristics, such as physical, chemical, and biological properties, which influence how it can be managed. Physical characteristics include size, shape, and density, while chemical characteristics involve the organic and inorganic components, toxicity, and flammability. Biological characteristics focus on the decomposability of the waste and its impact on health. Hazardous waste, in particular, poses serious risks due to its toxicity. Understanding these characteristics is essential for developing effective strategies for solid waste management and minimizing its environmental impact.</p>

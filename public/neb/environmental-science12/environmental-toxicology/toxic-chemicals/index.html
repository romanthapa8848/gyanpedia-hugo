<p>Toxic chemicals are substances that, when introduced into the environment, can cause harmful effects to living organisms, including humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms. These chemicals can be natural or synthetic and can enter the environment through various means, including industrial processes, agricultural activities, and waste disposal. Understanding toxic chemicals and their effects is crucial for protecting both environmental and public health.</p>
<h2 id="1-definition-of-toxic-chemicals">1. Definition of Toxic Chemicals</h2>
<p>Toxic chemicals are substances that can cause damage to living organisms by interfering with normal biological functions. The toxicity of a chemical depends on various factors such as its dose, the duration of exposure, and the specific characteristics of the exposed organism.</p>
<h3 id="key-points">Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toxicity</strong>: The degree to which a substance can harm an organism.</li>
<li><strong>Dose-Response Relationship</strong>: The response of an organism to a substance depends on the amount (dose) it is exposed to.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Properties</strong>: Chemicals vary in toxicity based on their physical and chemical properties (e.g., solubility, reactivity, persistence).</li>
</ul>

         <h1 id="rutherfords-atomic-model">Rutherford&rsquo;s Atomic Model</h1>
<p>Ernest Rutherford, in 1911, proposed a new model of the atom based on his famous <strong>gold foil experiment</strong>. This model revolutionized the understanding of atomic structure and laid the foundation for later models, including the Bohr model.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="rutherfords-gold-foil-experiment">Rutherford&rsquo;s Gold Foil Experiment</h2>
<p>In this experiment, Rutherford directed a beam of alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil. Based on the earlier <strong>Thomson model</strong> of the atom (the &ldquo;plum pudding model&rdquo;), it was expected that the alpha particles would pass through the gold foil with minimal deflection.</p>
<p>However, the results were surprising:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Most alpha particles</strong> passed through the foil without deflection.</li>
<li>A small fraction of the particles were <strong>deflected at large angles</strong>.</li>
<li>A very small number of particles were <strong>scattered directly back</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This led Rutherford to conclude that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>atom is mostly empty space</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>positive charge</strong> of the atom is concentrated in a very small region at the center, which he called the <strong>nucleus</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>electrons</strong> revolve around the nucleus at a distance, with the mass of the atom being concentrated in the nucleus.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="key-features-of-rutherfords-model">Key Features of Rutherford&rsquo;s Model</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nucleus</strong>: The atom has a dense central core called the nucleus, which contains all the positive charge and almost all the mass of the atom.</li>
<li><strong>Electrons</strong>: Electrons revolve around the nucleus in orbits, similar to planets revolving around the Sun.</li>
<li><strong>Size of the Atom</strong>: The size of the atom is mainly due to the space in which the electrons move, and the nucleus is very small compared to the overall size of the atom.</li>
<li><strong>Positively Charged Nucleus</strong>: The nucleus contains positively charged particles called <strong>protons</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The model was a significant step forward but was later modified by Niels Bohr to explain the stability of the atom.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="limitations-of-rutherfords-model">Limitations of Rutherford&rsquo;s Model</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Instability of Electrons</strong>: According to classical electromagnetic theory, revolving electrons would emit radiation and lose energy. This would cause them to spiral into the nucleus, leading to the collapse of the atom, which did not happen in reality.</li>
<li><strong>Failure to Explain Atomic Spectra</strong>: The model could not explain the discrete lines observed in atomic spectra, as it did not account for the quantized nature of electron energy levels.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="contributions-to-atomic-theory">Contributions to Atomic Theory</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery of the nucleus</strong>: Rutherford&rsquo;s model showed that atoms have a small, dense nucleus, which was a major breakthrough in atomic theory.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation for future models</strong>: His work paved the way for Niels Bohr’s model, which successfully explained the stability of atoms and the structure of electron orbits.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rutherford’s atomic model proposed that the atom consists of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons.</li>
<li>His gold foil experiment led to the discovery of the atomic nucleus.</li>
<li>Although the model had limitations, it was an important step in the development of modern atomic theory.</li>

<p>Bohr’s atomic model was proposed in 1913 by Niels Bohr to address the limitations of Rutherford&rsquo;s atomic model. The model explained the stability of the atom and the discrete nature of atomic spectra. Bohr introduced the concept of <strong>quantized orbits</strong> or energy levels, which revolutionized the understanding of atomic structure.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="postulates-of-bohrs-atomic-model">Postulates of Bohr&rsquo;s Atomic Model</h2>
<p>Bohr’s model is based on the following <strong>three postulates</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="1-electron-orbits-or-energy-levels">1. <strong>Electron Orbits or Energy Levels</strong></h3>
<p>Bohr proposed that electrons revolve in stable, circular orbits around the nucleus without emitting radiation. These orbits are also called <strong>stationary orbits</strong> or <strong>energy levels</strong>. An electron in one of these orbits does not lose energy, and thus, it does not spiral inward toward the nucleus.</p>
<h3 id="2-quantization-of-angular-momentum">2. <strong>Quantization of Angular Momentum</strong></h3>
<p>Bohr postulated that the angular momentum of an electron in these orbits is quantized. It means that the angular momentum of an electron in the $n$-th orbit is an integral multiple of $\hbar$ (reduced Planck’s constant):</p>
$$
L = n \hbar = n \frac{h}{2\pi}
$$<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$L$ is the angular momentum of the electron</li>
<li>$n$ is a positive integer called the <strong>principal quantum number</strong></li>
<li>$h$ is Planck’s constant</li>
</ul>
<p>This quantization leads to the concept of discrete energy levels for electrons.</p>
<h3 id="3-energy-emission-or-absorption">3. <strong>Energy Emission or Absorption</strong></h3>
<p>When an electron moves from a higher energy orbit to a lower energy orbit, energy is emitted in the form of <strong>photons</strong>. The energy of the photon is equal to the difference in energy between the two orbits:</p>
$$
\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = h \nu
$$<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$E_1$ and $E_2$ are the energies of the initial and final orbits</li>
<li>$h$ is Planck’s constant</li>
<li>$\nu$ is the frequency of the emitted photon</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, when an electron absorbs energy, it jumps to a higher orbit.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="applications-of-bohrs-atomic-model">Applications of Bohr’s Atomic Model</h2>
<p>Bohr’s model successfully explained several phenomena that could not be addressed by Rutherford’s model, particularly the behavior of hydrogen atoms and atomic spectra.</p>
<h3 id="1-explanation-of-hydrogen-spectrum">1. <strong>Explanation of Hydrogen Spectrum</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most significant successes of Bohr’s model was its explanation of the <strong>hydrogen spectrum</strong>. Bohr’s quantized orbits explained why hydrogen emitted light at discrete wavelengths when it was excited. These wavelengths corresponded to transitions between different energy levels.</p>
<p>For a hydrogen atom, the energy levels are given by the formula:</p>
$$
E_n = - \frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}
$$<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$E_n$ is the energy of the $n$-th energy level</li>
<li>$n$ is the principal quantum number (1, 2, 3,&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference in energy levels ($E_2 - E_1$) corresponds to the frequency of the emitted photon, which produces the <strong>Balmer series</strong> of visible spectral lines in the hydrogen atom.</p>
<h3 id="2-bohrs-model-and-the-stability-of-the-atom">2. <strong>Bohr’s Model and the Stability of the Atom</strong></h3>
<p>Bohr’s model resolved the issue of the <strong>stability of the atom</strong>. In Rutherford’s model, electrons were predicted to spiral into the nucleus due to the emission of radiation. However, Bohr showed that electrons in certain stable orbits (quantized orbits) do not lose energy, and thus, atoms remain stable.</p>
<h3 id="3-prediction-of-spectral-lines">3. <strong>Prediction of Spectral Lines</strong></h3>
<p>Bohr’s model accurately predicted the wavelengths of spectral lines for hydrogen. By using the formula for the energy of orbits and the energy difference between two orbits, Bohr was able to predict the wavelengths of light emitted or absorbed when an electron transitions between these orbits. The result was the <strong>Balmer series</strong> for visible light and other series for ultraviolet and infrared light.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Bohr’s atomic model introduced the concept of quantized electron orbits, explaining the stability of atoms and the discrete nature of atomic spectra. It successfully accounted for the hydrogen spectrum and the behavior of electrons in atoms, marking a significant advancement in atomic theory. The model laid the groundwork for later developments in quantum mechanics, although it had limitations in explaining atoms with more than one electron.</p>

  <div class="math-content"><h1 id="liquidity-ratios-current-ratio-quick-ratio">Liquidity Ratios: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio</h1>
<p>Liquidity ratios are financial metrics used to evaluate a company&rsquo;s ability to meet its short-term obligations. These ratios are vital for assessing the financial health of a business, ensuring it has enough assets to cover its immediate liabilities. The two primary liquidity ratios are the <strong>Current Ratio</strong> and the <strong>Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-current-ratio">1. <strong>Current Ratio</strong></h2>
<p>The current ratio is one of the most widely used liquidity ratios. It measures a company’s ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. This ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities.</p>
<h3 id="formula">Formula:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio</strong> =
$$
  \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
  $$</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>current ratio of 2:1</strong> is generally considered healthy, meaning the company has twice the amount of current assets as its current liabilities.</li>
<li>A ratio <strong>below 1</strong> indicates that the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations, as its liabilities exceed its assets.</li>
<li>A <strong>very high current ratio</strong> could suggest that the company is not utilizing its assets effectively or is holding too much cash or inventory.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example">Example:</h3>
<p>If a company has current assets of $500,000 and current liabilities of $250,000:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio</strong> =
$$
  \frac{500,000}{250,000} = 2.0
  $$</li>
</ul>
<p>This means the company has $2 in assets for every $1 of liability, indicating good liquidity.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-quick-ratio-acid-test-ratio">2. <strong>Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)</strong></h2>
<p>The quick ratio is a more stringent measure of liquidity compared to the current ratio. It excludes inventory from current assets, as inventory may not always be easily converted into cash. The quick ratio focuses on the most liquid assets like cash, marketable securities, and receivables.</p>
<h3 id="formula-1">Formula:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio</strong> =
$$
  \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
  $$</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interpretation-1">Interpretation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>quick ratio of 1:1</strong> is typically considered acceptable, meaning the company has enough liquid assets to cover its current liabilities.</li>
<li>A <strong>ratio lower than 1</strong> indicates that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations without selling inventory.</li>
<li>A <strong>higher quick ratio</strong> suggests strong liquidity but may indicate underutilization of assets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-1">Example:</h3>
<p>If a company has current assets of $500,000, inventory of $150,000, and current liabilities of $250,000:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio</strong> =
$$
  \frac{500,000 - 150,000}{250,000} = \frac{350,000}{250,000} = 1.4
  $$</li>
</ul>
<p>This indicates the company can cover its short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets, which is a positive sign of financial stability.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Current Ratio</strong> provides an overall measure of a company&rsquo;s ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets, while the <strong>Quick Ratio</strong> provides a more conservative view by excluding inventory from current assets.</li>
<li>Both ratios are important for assessing a company’s liquidity position, but the quick ratio is more useful for evaluating situations where inventory might not be easily converted to cash.</li>
</ul>

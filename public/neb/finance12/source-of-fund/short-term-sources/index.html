<p>Short-term financing refers to funds that are borrowed or raised for a period typically less than a year. These funds are used to meet immediate or short-term needs, such as managing working capital, paying current liabilities, or funding seasonal operations. Short-term sources of finance are vital for maintaining liquidity and supporting the day-to-day operations of a business.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="2-trade-credit">2. <strong>Trade Credit</strong></h3>

<h4 id="key-features-1">Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>No immediate cash outflow.</li>
<li>Interest-free, as long as payments are made on time.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="3-bill-of-exchange">3. <strong>Bill of Exchange</strong></h3>
<p>A bill of exchange is a written order used in international trade that requires the buyer to pay a specified amount on a certain date. It can be used as a short-term source of finance by discounting the bill with a bank.</p>

<li>Provides funds quickly.</li>
<li>Can be discounted with a bank for immediate cash.</li>

<h2 id="advantages-of-short-term-sources-of-finance"><strong>Advantages of Short-Term Sources of Finance</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Availability</strong>: Short-term financing options are usually quicker to arrange than long-term financing, providing immediate liquidity to businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Many short-term sources, like bank overdrafts and trade credit, offer flexibility in terms of usage and repayment, making them suitable for fluctuating cash flow needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lower Interest Rates</strong>: Short-term sources of finance generally come with lower interest rates compared to long-term loans, making them cost-effective for temporary funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Collateral Required</strong>: Many short-term financing options, such as trade credit, do not require collateral, reducing the risk for the business owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Short Repayment Period</strong>: Since short-term financing is typically repaid within a year, businesses are not burdened with long-term debt obligations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-short-term-sources-of-finance"><strong>Disadvantages of Short-Term Sources of Finance</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Higher Interest Rates (for some sources)</strong>: While many short-term financing options have lower rates, sources like short-term loans and commercial paper can sometimes carry relatively high-interest rates, depending on the business’s credit rating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk of Over-Reliance</strong>: Relying too heavily on short-term sources of finance can lead to liquidity problems and may cause a business to face a cash flow crunch if repayments are not managed properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Availability</strong>: Some short-term financing options, such as commercial paper, may only be available to large businesses with strong credit histories, making them inaccessible to smaller firms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential Impact on Relationships with Suppliers</strong>: Excessive use of trade credit or delayed payments can strain relationships with suppliers, potentially leading to reduced credit limits or a loss of credit terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repayment Pressure</strong>: The short repayment terms for these sources can create pressure on businesses to generate cash quickly, which could impact overall financial stability.</p>
</li>
</ol>

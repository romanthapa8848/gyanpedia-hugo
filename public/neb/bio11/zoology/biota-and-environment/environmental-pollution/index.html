<p>Environmental pollution refers to the contamination of the natural environment due to human activities, leading to harmful effects on ecosystems and human health. The primary forms of pollution include air, water, and soil pollution, all of which have significant sources, adverse effects, and potential control measures. The use of pesticides also contributes to environmental pollution, with various harmful effects on organisms and ecosystems.</p>
<h2 id="1-air-pollution-sources-effects-and-control-measures">1. <strong>Air Pollution: Sources, Effects, and Control Measures</strong></h2>
<h3 id="sources-of-air-pollution">Sources of Air Pollution:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vehicular emissions</strong>: The burning of fossil fuels in vehicles releases carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial emissions</strong>: Factories release pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</li>
<li><strong>Agricultural activities</strong>: The use of fertilizers, pesticides, and livestock farming can produce ammonia and methane.</li>

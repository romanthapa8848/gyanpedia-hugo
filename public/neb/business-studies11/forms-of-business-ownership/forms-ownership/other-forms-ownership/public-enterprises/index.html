<p>Public enterprises are organizations owned and managed by the government at various levels (local, regional, or national). These entities are established to carry out commercial activities or provide services that are essential for national development. They play a critical role in the economic and social development of countries, particularly in sectors where private sector investment may not be forthcoming or practical.</p>
<h2 id="concept-of-public-enterprises"><strong>Concept of Public Enterprises</strong></h2>
<p>Public enterprises are businesses where the government owns a majority of the shares or has full control over the operations. These enterprises may be formed as statutory bodies, government-owned corporations, or public limited companies. Their primary objective is often to serve the public interest by providing services, utilities, or goods that are necessary for the welfare of the population.</p>

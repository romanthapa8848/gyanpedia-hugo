<p><strong>Creative behaviour</strong> refers to the actions and thought processes that lead to the generation of new and original ideas. It is not simply about coming up with ideas but involves the steps and practices that encourage the development of innovative solutions. Creativity in business is crucial for staying competitive, solving problems, and offering new products or services.</p>
<h3 id="key-aspects-of-creative-behaviour">Key Aspects of Creative Behaviour</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Problem-Solving</strong>: Creative behaviour often begins with identifying and solving problems in a unique way. This involves looking at challenges from different perspectives and coming up with solutions that others might not consider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Idea Generation</strong>: The ability to generate a variety of ideas, without initial concern for their feasibility or practicality, is central to creative behaviour. This phase encourages free thinking and exploration of different possibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Originality</strong>: Creative behaviour emphasizes originality. It’s not enough to come up with ideas; they must be new, unique, and different from existing solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk-Taking</strong>: Creativity involves taking risks by trying new approaches or experimenting with untested ideas. This willingness to take chances helps in overcoming fear of failure and fosters innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Persistence</strong>: Creative behaviour requires persistence to refine ideas, overcome challenges, and continue working toward a solution even when obstacles arise.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Individual Factors</strong>:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<p>The primary market is where new securities are issued and sold to the public for the first time. This market is essential for companies looking to raise capital by offering shares or bonds to investors. In this section, we will explore the different methods through which investors can participate in the primary market, specifically focusing on <strong>Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)</strong>, <strong>Follow-on Public Offerings (FPOs)</strong>, and <strong>Rights Offerings</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-initial-public-offering-ipo">1. <strong>Initial Public Offering (IPO)</strong></h2>
<p>An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the process through which a private company offers its shares to the public for the first time, transitioning from a private entity to a publicly traded one.</p>
<h3 id="key-points">Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Raising</strong>: Companies use IPOs to raise capital for expansion, debt repayment, or other business activities.</li>
<li><strong>Public Ownership</strong>: Once the IPO is completed, the company becomes publicly owned, with shares available for purchase on stock exchanges.</li>
<li><strong>Price Setting</strong>: The price of shares in an IPO is usually determined through a process of book building or fixed pricing.</li>
<li><strong>Underwriting</strong>: Investment banks typically underwrite IPOs, helping the company with the offering and ensuring the shares are sold.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example">Example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A tech startup may decide to go public by offering 10 million shares through an IPO, raising funds to expand its operations and develop new products.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-follow-on-public-offering-fpo">2. <strong>Follow-on Public Offering (FPO)</strong></h2>
<p>A Follow-on Public Offering (FPO) is a secondary offering of shares made by a company that is already publicly listed. This offering allows the company to raise additional capital after its IPO.</p>
<h3 id="key-points-1">Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raising Additional Capital</strong>: An FPO is used when a company requires more funds after its initial offering, either for growth, acquisitions, or debt repayment.</li>
<li><strong>Offer Types</strong>: There are two types of FPOs—dilutive and non-dilutive. In a dilutive FPO, new shares are issued, diluting the value of existing shares. In a non-dilutive FPO, existing shareholders sell their shares without the issuance of new ones.</li>
<li><strong>Market Conditions</strong>: FPOs often occur when the company’s stock price has risen significantly since its IPO, and investors are willing to buy more shares.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-1">Example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A publicly traded retail company, after experiencing growth, decides to issue an additional 5 million shares through an FPO to fund its new store openings.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-rights-offering">3. <strong>Rights Offering</strong></h2>
<p>A Rights Offering allows existing shareholders to purchase additional shares directly from the company, typically at a discounted price, before the shares are offered to the public. This helps the company raise capital while giving existing shareholders the first opportunity to maintain their ownership stake.</p>
<h3 id="key-points-2">Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discounted Price</strong>: Existing shareholders are usually offered a discount to buy additional shares at a price lower than the current market value.</li>
<li><strong>Pro-Rata Basis</strong>: Shareholders are given &ldquo;rights&rdquo; to purchase a proportional amount of new shares based on their existing holdings.</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining Ownership</strong>: The rights offering enables shareholders to maintain their proportionate ownership in the company and avoid dilution.</li>
<li><strong>Short Period</strong>: Rights offerings typically occur within a short period, often around 15 to 30 days.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-2">Example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A pharmaceutical company experiencing financial strain may issue a rights offering, allowing its current shareholders to buy more shares at a 20% discount to raise funds for its new drug research.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>IPOs</strong>, <strong>FPOs</strong>, and <strong>Rights Offerings</strong> are essential methods of raising capital in the primary market.</li>
<li><strong>IPOs</strong> allow private companies to go public and raise funds by selling shares for the first time.</li>
<li><strong>FPOs</strong> enable publicly traded companies to raise more capital through the sale of additional shares.</li>
<li><strong>Rights Offerings</strong> give existing shareholders the opportunity to buy more shares at a discounted price, helping the company raise capital while protecting shareholder interests.</li>
</ul>

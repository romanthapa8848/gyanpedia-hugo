<p><strong>Life insurance</strong> is a financial product that provides a monetary benefit to a beneficiary in the event of the policyholder&rsquo;s death. It acts as a safeguard against the financial impact of an untimely demise and ensures that the dependents of the policyholder are financially protected. Life insurance can also have an investment component, offering benefits like savings and retirement planning.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="concept-of-life-insurance">Concept of Life Insurance</h2>
<p>Life insurance is a contract between the insurer and the insured, where the insurer promises to pay a certain sum of money upon the death of the insured, or after a specified period if the insured survives the policy term. The policyholder is required to pay regular premiums, and in return, the insurer provides coverage for life risk, health risk, or both, depending on the type of life insurance plan chosen.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-life-insurance">Types of Life Insurance</h3>
<p>There are various types of life insurance policies available, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Term Life Insurance</strong>: Provides coverage for a specific period, usually at a lower premium.</li>
<li><strong>Whole Life Insurance</strong>: Offers coverage for the entire lifetime of the policyholder and includes a savings component.</li>
<li><strong>Endowment Plans</strong>: Combine insurance and investment, providing a lump sum benefit either on death or at the end of a set term.</li>
<li><strong>Unit-Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs)</strong>: A hybrid product that combines life insurance with investment in market-linked instruments.</li>
</ul>

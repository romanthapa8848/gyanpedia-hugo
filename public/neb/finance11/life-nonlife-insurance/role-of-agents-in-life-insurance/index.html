<p>In the life insurance industry, <strong>agents</strong> play a crucial role as intermediaries between the insurer and the policyholder. They serve as the main point of contact for customers, guiding them through the process of selecting the right insurance coverage. The role of agents goes beyond just selling policies; they also provide advice, handle paperwork, and assist with claims. Their responsibilities are essential in ensuring that the right policies are chosen and that customers are satisfied with their coverage.</p>

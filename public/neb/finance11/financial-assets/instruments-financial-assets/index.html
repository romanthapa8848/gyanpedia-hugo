<p>Financial assets are represented by various instruments that provide value through ownership rights, contractual claims, or investment in future cash flows. These instruments are key to the functioning of financial markets and form the foundation of investments. Understanding the various types of financial instruments is essential for investors looking to build a diversified portfolio.</p>

<h3 id="1-stocks-equity-shares">1. <strong>Stocks (Equity Shares)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Stocks represent ownership in a company. When an investor buys stock, they are purchasing a share of the company&rsquo;s equity, which entitles them to a portion of the company’s profits (dividends) and voting rights in major decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong>: Shareholders are partial owners of the company.</li>
<li><strong>Risk</strong>: Stocks are subject to market volatility and can result in a loss if the company underperforms.</li>
<li><strong>Return</strong>: Returns come in the form of dividends and capital gains from price appreciation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-bonds-debt-instruments">2. <strong>Bonds (Debt Instruments)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Bonds are debt securities issued by corporations, municipalities, or governments to raise capital. When an investor buys a bond, they are lending money to the issuer in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of the principal at maturity.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest</strong>: Bonds pay interest, typically on a fixed schedule (semi-annual or annual).</li>
<li><strong>Credit Risk</strong>: The issuer’s creditworthiness affects bond prices and interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>Maturity</strong>: Bonds have a defined maturity date, after which the principal is repaid.</li>
<li><strong>Types</strong>: Government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-derivatives">3. <strong>Derivatives</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from the price of an underlying asset, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies. Common derivatives include options, futures, and swaps.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Hedging</strong>: Derivatives are often used to hedge against risk in other investments.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage</strong>: Derivatives can magnify profits or losses, as small changes in the price of the underlying asset can lead to significant changes in the derivative&rsquo;s value.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Derivatives can be complex and are typically traded by more experienced investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-mutual-funds">4. <strong>Mutual Funds</strong></h3>

</ul>

<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Liquidity</strong>: ETFs can be bought or sold throughout the trading day, providing liquidity.</li>
<li><strong>Low Fees</strong>: ETFs typically have lower management fees compared to mutual funds.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-commodities">6. <strong>Commodities</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Commodities are physical assets such as gold, oil, agricultural products, or metals, that can be bought and sold in the market. Commodities are often considered a hedge against inflation.</li>

<li><strong>Physical Assets</strong>: Unlike stocks or bonds, commodities are tangible goods.</li>
<li><strong>Price Volatility</strong>: Commodity prices can be highly volatile due to supply and demand factors.</li>

<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Risk</strong>: CDs are considered low-risk investments since they are typically insured by government agencies (in some countries).</li>

</ul>

<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Safe Haven</strong>: T-Bills are considered one of the safest investments, as they are backed by the government.</li>
<li><strong>Short-Term Investment</strong>: T-Bills are typically used for short-term investment needs.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity</strong>: They are highly liquid, as they can be sold in secondary markets before maturity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-real-estate-investment-trusts-reits">9. <strong>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)</strong></h3>
<ul>

<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul>

<li><strong>Diversification</strong>: REITs offer diversification into the real estate market, which can reduce overall portfolio risk.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity</strong>: REITs are traded on stock exchanges, making them liquid.</li>

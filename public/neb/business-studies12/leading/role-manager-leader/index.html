<li><strong>Manager as a Boss</strong>: The focus is on authority, control, and maintaining order. A boss typically gives instructions, expects compliance, and emphasizes performance.</li>
<li><strong>Manager as a Leader</strong>: The focus is on motivation, empowerment, and collaboration. A leader encourages innovation, supports personal development, and fosters a sense of shared responsibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Effective managers integrate both approaches, using leadership to inspire and management skills to ensure efficient operations.</p>

<p>Administrative Management is a theory of management that focuses on the organization as a whole rather than the individual worker. Developed by Henri Fayol, this approach emphasizes planning, organizing, and controlling to achieve organizational goals efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="principles-of-administrative-management">Principles of Administrative Management</h3>

<li>Clear lines of authority prevent misunderstandings and conflicts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unity of Direction</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<hr>
<h3 id="limitations-of-administrative-management">Limitations of Administrative Management</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Overemphasis on Formalization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fayol’s principles emphasize formal rules and procedures, which may lead to rigidity in the organization.</li>
<li>This can stifle creativity and innovation, particularly in dynamic environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Flexibility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The principles can be too rigid, leading to a lack of flexibility and adaptability.</li>
<li>Organizations need to adjust to changing circumstances, but strict adherence to rules may hinder change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not Focused on Worker Needs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>While Fayol’s principles emphasize efficiency, they do not sufficiently address the social and psychological needs of workers.</li>
<li>This could result in low morale and dissatisfaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Applicability in Modern Organizations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The principles are based on a top-down structure, which may not work well in modern organizations with flat hierarchies or decentralized decision-making.</li>
<li>It is less suitable for organizations that value innovation, autonomy, and flexibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Over-Simplification</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fayol’s principles provide a general framework for management but may oversimplify the complexities of modern organizational structures.</li>
<li>It doesn’t fully account for the dynamic and complex nature of modern management environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not Universally Applicable</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The principles were developed in the early 20th century, and they may not be applicable to all types of organizations, especially those in rapidly changing industries or those with different cultural contexts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

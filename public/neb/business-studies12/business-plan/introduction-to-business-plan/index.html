<p>A business plan is a formal written document that outlines the goals, strategies, and financial projections of a business. It is a roadmap for the business, detailing the steps required to achieve business objectives. A business plan is not only vital for attracting investors or securing funding but also acts as a guide for managing the operations and growth of the business.</p>
<p>Creating a business plan involves research, analysis, and planning to clearly define the business’s direction and how it intends to achieve its goals. Business plans are commonly used in startups, but even established businesses may need one when launching a new product or service, seeking investment, or entering a new market.</p>

         <h1 id="definition-of-health-definition-of-mental-health-who">Definition of Health, Definition of Mental Health (WHO)</h1>
<p>Health is a fundamental concept in psychology and medicine, often seen as more than the mere absence of disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines both health and mental health in broad terms that emphasize overall well-being, acknowledging the complexity of both physical and mental aspects of health.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="definition-of-health-who">Definition of Health (WHO)</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as:</p>
<p><strong>“A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”</strong></p>
<p>This definition expands the understanding of health beyond just the absence of illness, placing equal importance on the physical, mental, and social dimensions of health. It emphasizes that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Health</strong>: Refers to the well-functioning of the body and its systems. It includes factors like proper nutrition, exercise, and disease prevention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental Health</strong>: Focuses on emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Mental health affects how we think, feel, and behave, influencing our capacity to handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Well-being</strong>: Involves the ability to form meaningful relationships, participate in social activities, and maintain a sense of connection with the community.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, health is not just the absence of physical ailments but an overall state of balance in multiple aspects of life.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="definition-of-mental-health-who">Definition of Mental Health (WHO)</h2>
<p>Mental health, according to the WHO, is defined as:</p>
<p><strong>“A state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.”</strong></p>
<p>This definition highlights several key aspects of mental health:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Realizing One&rsquo;s Abilities</strong>: Mental health involves understanding and accepting your strengths and potential, and using them to pursue goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coping with Stress</strong>: The ability to manage daily challenges and stressors is a key indicator of mental health. It involves having the resilience to navigate life&rsquo;s difficulties without being overwhelmed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Productivity</strong>: Mental health enables a person to work efficiently, whether in a professional, educational, or personal context. This includes being able to focus, make decisions, and perform tasks well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community Contribution</strong>: Good mental health allows individuals to contribute positively to society, engage in social relationships, and support others. It encourages active participation in community life.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders; it involves living a fulfilling and balanced life, with the capacity for personal growth and meaningful interactions with others.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

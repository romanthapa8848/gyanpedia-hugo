<p>Energy is essential for economic development and quality of life. The global demand for energy is increasing due to rising populations, urbanization, and industrial growth. Meeting this demand requires a balanced approach, utilizing both renewable and non-renewable energy sources. The supply of energy is currently dominated by non-renewable sources, such as fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), but renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydropower are rapidly gaining importance due to their environmental benefits and sustainability.</p>
<h3 id="demand-supply-trend-of-energy">Demand-Supply Trend of Energy</h3>
<p>Energy demand has been increasing steadily due to factors like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Population growth</li>
<li>Technological advancement</li>
<li>Industrialization and urbanization, especially in developing countries</li>
</ul>
<p>Historically, non-renewable energy sources have satisfied most of this demand. However, due to their environmental impact and finite availability, there is a growing shift towards renewable energy sources.</p>
<h3 id="energy-projections">Energy Projections</h3>
<p>Projections for the future indicate:</p>
<ul>
<li>A continued rise in global energy demand, especially in developing nations.</li>
<li>A growing share for renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydropower) as their costs decrease and efficiency improves.</li>
<li>Fossil fuels will still play a role in energy supply, but their share is expected to decline.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="renewable-and-non-renewable-energy-sources">Renewable and Non-Renewable Energy Sources</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Includes sources like solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and biomass.</li>
<li>These are sustainable, continuously replenished, and have minimal environmental impacts.</li>
<li>Solar and wind energy are expected to lead the transition due to decreasing costs and widespread adoption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-Renewable Energy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Includes fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) and nuclear energy.</li>
<li>These sources are finite, and their extraction and use lead to environmental degradation (air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions).</li>
<li>While essential for current energy needs, non-renewable energy is not sustainable in the long term.</li>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The global energy landscape is evolving, with an increasing shift towards renewable energy sources. The demand for energy is projected to rise due to population growth and industrialization, but the reliance on non-renewable energy sources is expected to decline as renewable energy technologies advance. To ensure a sustainable future, it is crucial to continue developing and investing in renewable energy solutions while managing the transition away from finite and polluting non-renewable sources.</p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<h3 id="1-what-are-renewable-energy-sources">1. What are renewable energy sources?</h3>
<p>Renewable energy sources are those that are replenished naturally, such as sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal energy. They are sustainable and have minimal environmental impact.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-is-the-difference-between-renewable-and-non-renewable-energy">2. What is the difference between renewable and non-renewable energy?</h3>
<p>Renewable energy comes from sources that are replenished naturally and can be used indefinitely. Non-renewable energy comes from finite sources like coal, oil, and natural gas, which will eventually be exhausted.</p>
<h3 id="3-why-is-renewable-energy-important">3. Why is renewable energy important?</h3>
<p>Renewable energy is important because it is sustainable, has minimal environmental impact, and helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making it crucial for addressing climate change.</p>
<h3 id="4-what-are-the-benefits-of-wind-energy">4. What are the benefits of wind energy?</h3>
<p>Wind energy is renewable, produces no greenhouse gas emissions, and is an efficient source of electricity generation, especially in areas with high wind potential.</p>
<h3 id="5-what-are-the-challenges-in-using-solar-energy">5. What are the challenges in using solar energy?</h3>

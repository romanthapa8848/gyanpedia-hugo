# Metal and Alloys: Introduction

Metals and alloys are fundamental materials in engineering and construction, known for their strength, durability, and versatility. They are used in various applications, from infrastructure to consumer goods. Understanding the properties and classifications of metals and alloys is crucial for selecting the right material for specific applications.

## 1. Definition of Metals and Alloys

### Metals

Metals are solid materials that exhibit high electrical and thermal conductivity, malleability, ductility, and luster. They are characterized by their ability to lose electrons and form positive ions. Common examples include iron, aluminum, copper, and gold.

### Alloys

Alloys are mixtures of two or more elements, typically consisting of one or more metals and other elements. Alloys are designed to enhance certain properties, such as strength, corrosion resistance, and toughness. Examples include steel (an alloy of iron and carbon), bronze (an alloy of copper and tin), and brass (an alloy of copper and zinc).

## 2. Classification of Metals

### a. Ferrous Metals

- **Description:** Ferrous metals contain iron as their primary component. They are known for their strength and magnetic properties.
- **Examples:** Steel, cast iron, wrought iron.

### b. Non-Ferrous Metals

- **Description:** Non-ferrous metals do not contain significant amounts of iron and are generally more resistant to corrosion.
- **Examples:** Aluminum, copper, lead, zinc, titanium.

### c. Precious Metals

- **Description:** Precious metals are rare and valuable due to their rarity and favorable properties, such as corrosion resistance.
- **Examples:** Gold, silver, platinum.

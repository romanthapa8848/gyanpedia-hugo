## 2. Properties of Timber

### a. Physical Properties

- **Density:** Varies by species, affecting strength and durability.
- **Moisture Content:** Influences dimensional stability and susceptibility to decay.
- **Color and Grain:** Aesthetic attributes that vary across species, impacting design choices.

### b. Mechanical Properties

- **Strength:** Timber exhibits high strength-to-weight ratios, making it suitable for structural applications.
- **Elasticity:** Allows for flexibility under load, reducing the risk of cracking.
- **Durability:** Resistance to environmental factors such as moisture, pests, and decay depends on the species and treatment.

## 3. Types of Timber

Timber can be categorized into two main types:

### a. Softwood

- **Description:** Derived from coniferous trees (e.g., pine, spruce, fir).
- **Applications:** Commonly used in construction framing, furniture, and paper products.

### b. Hardwood

- **Description:** Obtained from deciduous trees (e.g., oak, maple, cherry).
- **Applications:** Often used for flooring, cabinetry, and high-quality furniture due to its density and durability.

## 4. Applications of Timber

Timber is widely used in various construction applications, including:

- **Structural Elements:** Beams, columns, and trusses in building frames.
- **Interior Finishes:** Flooring, paneling, and cabinetry for aesthetic appeal.
- **Outdoor Structures:** Decking, fences, and pergolas, benefiting from its natural resistance to weathering.
- **Sustainable Construction:** Increasingly used in green building practices due to its renewability and carbon sequestration capabilities.

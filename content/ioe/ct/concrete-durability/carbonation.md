# Carbonation of Concrete

Carbonation is a natural process that occurs when carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO_2}$) from the atmosphere reacts with calcium hydroxide ($\ce{Ca(OH)_2}$) present in the cement matrix of concrete. This reaction lowers the pH of the concrete, weakening the protection around embedded steel reinforcement, which can lead to corrosion.

## The Chemical Reaction

The primary chemical reaction involved in carbonation is as follows:

$$
\ce{Ca(OH)_2 + CO_2 -> CaCO_3 + H_2O}
$$

In this reaction:
- **Calcium hydroxide** ($\ce{Ca(OH)_2}$), present in the hardened cement paste, reacts with **carbon dioxide** ($\ce{CO_2}$) from the air.
- The products of this reaction are **calcium carbonate** ($\ce{CaCO_3}$), which can accumulate on the surface of the concrete, and **water** ($\ce{H_2O}$).

Although the formation of calcium carbonate can initially increase the hardness of the concrete surface, the overall effect of carbonation is a reduction in pH, which compromises the protective layer around the reinforcement.

### Impact on Reinforcement

The reduction in pH caused by carbonation makes the concrete more susceptible to the corrosion of steel reinforcement. In normal concrete, the high pH (typically above 12.5) forms a passive oxide layer on the steel, preventing corrosion. However, when the pH drops due to carbonation (typically below 9), this passive layer is disrupted, allowing chloride ions and moisture to reach the steel and initiate corrosion.

$$
\ce{Fe + O_2 + 2H_2O -> Fe(OH)_2 + 2H^+}
$$

As steel reinforcement corrodes, it expands, causing internal pressure that can crack and spall the concrete, leading to further deterioration.

## Factors Influencing Carbonation

The rate of carbonation is influenced by several factors:
1. **Carbon dioxide concentration**: Higher $\ce{CO_2}$ concentration in the air accelerates carbonation.
2. **Humidity**: Concrete in high-humidity environments experiences slower carbonation because the reaction is hindered in wet conditions.
3. **Temperature**: Higher temperatures can increase the rate of carbonation.
4. **Concrete permeability**: More permeable concrete allows $\ce{CO_2}$ to penetrate more deeply, speeding up carbonation.

## Prevention and Mitigation

- **Low Permeability Concrete**: Using lower water-cement ratios and adding pozzolanic materials like fly ash can reduce the permeability of concrete, slowing down carbonation.
- **Protective Coatings**: Applying coatings or sealants can prevent $\ce{CO_2}$ from coming into contact with the concrete surface.
- **Cathodic Protection**: In cases where carbonation has already occurred and corrosion is imminent, cathodic protection systems can be used to stop or slow down the corrosion of reinforcement.

## Summary

Carbonation is a significant chemical process that can affect the durability of concrete by lowering the pH of the material and promoting the corrosion of steel reinforcement. While it can initially lead to the formation of calcium carbonate on the surface, it weakens the concreteâ€™s ability to protect embedded reinforcement, thus reducing the lifespan of concrete structures. Preventative measures such as using low-permeability concrete and applying protective coatings can help mitigate the effects of carbonation.

## FAQs

### 1. What is carbonation in concrete?
Carbonation is a chemical reaction where carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO_2}$) from the air reacts with calcium hydroxide ($\ce{Ca(OH)_2}$) in the concrete, lowering its pH and making it more prone to reinforcement corrosion.

### 2. How does carbonation affect the steel reinforcement?
The lowered pH due to carbonation disrupts the passive oxide layer protecting the steel reinforcement, allowing moisture and chloride ions to reach the steel and initiate corrosion.

### 3. What are the chemical products formed during carbonation?
The reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide forms calcium carbonate ($\ce{CaCO_3}$) and water ($\ce{H_2O}$).

### 4. How does carbonation impact the durability of concrete?
As carbonation lowers the pH of concrete, it reduces the concrete's ability to protect embedded steel from corrosion, weakening the concrete structure over time.

### 5. What factors influence the rate of carbonation in concrete?
The rate of carbonation is influenced by factors like carbon dioxide concentration, humidity, temperature, and concrete permeability.

### 6. Can carbonation be prevented?
Carbonation can be slowed down by using low-permeability concrete, applying protective coatings, and controlling environmental conditions.

### 7. How can the effects of carbonation be mitigated?
Mitigation includes using low water-cement ratios, adding pozzolanic materials like fly ash, and applying protective coatings or cathodic protection systems.

### 8. Is carbonation harmful to all concrete structures?
Carbonation is particularly harmful to reinforced concrete structures, where it accelerates the corrosion of steel reinforcement, leading to potential structural failure.

### 9. Can carbonation improve the surface of concrete?
While carbonation initially forms calcium carbonate, which hardens the surface, its long-term effect reduces the protection of steel reinforcement, making the concrete more vulnerable to corrosion.

### 10. What is the role of carbonation in the service life of concrete?
Carbonation plays a key role in determining the service life of concrete structures, as it can lead to corrosion of reinforcement, which compromises the integrity and longevity of the structure.

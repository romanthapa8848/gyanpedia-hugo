# Conditions of Contract

The **Conditions of Contract** are a critical component of construction contracts. They define the rights, duties, and responsibilities of both parties (the client and the contractor) throughout the project. These conditions set the legal framework that governs the relationship and operations during the construction phase and provide guidance for handling any issues that may arise.

## 1. **General Conditions of Contract (GCC)**

   The **General Conditions of Contract (GCC)** form the standard legal foundation for a construction project. They cover broad issues that apply to all construction contracts and are typically based on industry standards.

   ### Key Components of GCC:
   - **Scope of Work:** Defines the nature and extent of the work the contractor is obligated to complete.
   - **Contractor’s Obligations:** Describes the duties of the contractor, including timelines, quality standards, and coordination with other parties.
   - **Client’s Obligations:** Outlines the responsibilities of the client, such as providing access to the site and timely payments.
   - **Payment Terms:** Specifies the conditions for payments, including the schedule, rates, and milestones.
   - **Delays and Extensions:** Provides conditions under which extensions can be granted and the contractor’s obligations if delays occur.
   - **Dispute Resolution:** Establishes procedures for resolving disputes, including negotiation, mediation, and arbitration.
   - **Termination:** Outlines the conditions under which the contract may be terminated by either party, including non-performance or force majeure.

## 2. **Special Conditions of Contract (SCC)**

   The **Special Conditions of Contract (SCC)** are specific to each construction project and supplement the General Conditions. These conditions address project-specific factors such as timelines, quality standards, and particular client requirements.

   ### Key Components of SCC:
   - **Project-Specific Requirements:** Conditions that define particular aspects of the project that are not covered in the general contract, such as work methods, safety standards, or environmental impact.
   - **Project Timeline and Deadlines:** Defines specific milestones, deadlines, and project completion dates unique to the project.
   - **Insurance and Liabilities:** Establishes specific insurance requirements for the project, covering aspects like worker safety, site protection, and third-party liabilities.
   - **Penalties for Delay:** Defines financial penalties if the contractor fails to meet specific milestones or the project’s completion deadline.
   - **Changes in Work Scope:** Details the procedure for handling any changes or additions to the scope of work, including cost adjustments and time extensions.
   - **Subcontracting and Outsourcing:** Specifies conditions under which the contractor is allowed to subcontract work, and outlines the responsibilities of subcontractors.

## 3. **Key Differences Between GCC and SCC**

   - **General Conditions of Contract (GCC)** apply universally to all construction contracts and are based on industry standards, whereas **Special Conditions of Contract (SCC)** are tailored to the specific requirements of each project.
   - **GCC** addresses broad contractual and legal issues, such as dispute resolution and payment terms, while **SCC** covers project-specific details, including timelines, project scope, and additional client expectations.
   - The **GCC** is non-negotiable in most cases, while the **SCC** may be adjusted depending on the unique needs of the project and client.

## 4. **Importance of Conditions of Contract**

   - **Clarification of Roles and Responsibilities:** Clear conditions ensure both parties understand their obligations, reducing the risk of misunderstandings.
   - **Risk Management:** The conditions outline how risks, such as delays, accidents, or cost overruns, are handled, providing legal protection for both parties.
   - **Dispute Resolution:** Well-drafted conditions provide a roadmap for resolving disputes, preventing lengthy legal battles and minimizing delays.
   - **Consistency and Fairness:** Standard conditions ensure that all parties are treated fairly, maintaining consistency across different projects and contractors.
   - **Legal Framework:** In case of any dispute, the conditions of contract provide a legally binding framework for enforcing terms and resolving issues.

## 5. **Steps in Drafting Conditions of Contract**

   - **Identify Key Requirements:** Understand the project's specific needs, including the type of work, project timeline, and any special conditions.
   - **Standardize General Conditions:** Use a standard set of general conditions to ensure that essential legal and procedural requirements are covered.
   - **Customize Special Conditions:** Tailor the special conditions to the specific project, addressing any unique needs such as safety standards, local regulations, or environmental concerns.
   - **Review Legal Requirements:** Ensure that the conditions comply with local laws and regulations and protect both parties’ legal rights.
   - **Consult Legal Experts:** Have legal professionals review the contract to ensure clarity, fairness, and compliance with applicable laws.
   - **Finalize and Communicate:** Once agreed upon, finalize the conditions and communicate them to all stakeholders, ensuring understanding and agreement.

- **Overestimating Revenue:** Overly optimistic revenue projections can lead to financial strain if actual payments are delayed or reduced.

### 3. **Managing Cash Flow**

Effective cash flow management involves:

- **Tracking Payments:** Ensure that payments are received on time and monitor the invoicing process.
- **Creating Cash Flow Projections:** Estimate future cash inflows and outflows to plan for potential cash shortages.

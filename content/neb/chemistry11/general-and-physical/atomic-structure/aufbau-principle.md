# Aufbau Principle

The **Aufbau Principle** is a fundamental concept in chemistry that explains the order in which electrons are added to atomic orbitals. According to this principle, electrons occupy orbitals in order of increasing energy levels, starting with the lowest energy orbital.

### Key Points of the Aufbau Principle:

1. **Electrons occupy orbitals in order of increasing energy**, starting with the lowest energy level.
2. **Energy levels and sublevels**: Orbitals are filled based on the increasing energy levels, with $1s$ being the lowest energy orbital.
3. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: No two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers. This means each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons, with opposite spins.
4. **Hund's Rule**: When electrons occupy degenerate orbitals (orbitals with the same energy, such as p, d, or f orbitals), one electron will enter each orbital until all orbitals are singly occupied. Only after that will electrons pair up.

### The Order of Filling Orbitals

The order in which orbitals are filled is determined by their energy levels. The general filling order is:

$$
1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 3d < 4p < 5s < 4d < 5p < 6s < 4f < 5d < 6p < 7s
$$

This sequence follows the **n + l rule** where $n$ is the principal quantum number and $l$ is the azimuthal quantum number. Orbitals with lower $n + l$ values are filled first, and for orbitals with the same $n + l$ value, the orbital with the lower $n$ is filled first.

### Example: Electron Configuration of Oxygen (O)

The atomic number of oxygen is 8, meaning it has 8 electrons. According to the Aufbau Principle, the electron configuration of oxygen will be:

$$
1s^2 2s^2 2p^4
$$

This means:

- The first 2 electrons fill the $1s$ orbital.
- The next 2 electrons fill the $2s$ orbital.
- The remaining 4 electrons fill the $2p$ orbital.

## Summary

- The **Aufbau Principle** states that electrons fill orbitals starting from the lowest energy level and move to higher energy levels.
- **Pauli Exclusion Principle** ensures that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers.
- **Hund's Rule** dictates that electrons will occupy degenerate orbitals singly before pairing up.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the Aufbau Principle?

The Aufbau Principle explains the order in which electrons occupy orbitals in an atom, filling the lowest energy orbitals first.

### 2. How are orbitals filled according to the Aufbau Principle?

Orbitals are filled in order of increasing energy, starting with the lowest energy orbital.

### 3. What is Hund's Rule?

Hund's Rule states that when electrons fill degenerate orbitals, they will occupy each orbital singly before pairing up.

### 4. How does the Pauli Exclusion Principle relate to the Aufbau Principle?

The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers, so each orbital can hold at most two electrons with opposite spins.

### 5. What is the general filling order of orbitals?

The general order in which orbitals are filled is:

$$
1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 3d < 4p < 5s < 4d < 5p < 6s < 4f < 5d < 6p < 7s
$$

### 6. Can an electron be placed in an orbital of higher energy before lower energy orbitals?

No, according to the Aufbau Principle, electrons must fill lower energy orbitals before higher energy orbitals.

### 7. How many electrons can an orbital hold?

Each orbital can hold a maximum of **2 electrons**, and they must have opposite spins.

### 8. What does the $n + l$ rule explain?

The $n + l$ rule helps determine the order in which orbitals are filled, based on their energy. The orbital with the lower $n + l$ value is filled first.

### 9. Does the Aufbau Principle apply to all elements?

Yes, the Aufbau Principle applies to all elements when determining their electron configurations, though for elements with very high atomic numbers, relativistic effects can cause deviations.

### 10. Why is the electron configuration of oxygen $1s^2 2s^2 2p^4$?

Oxygen has 8 electrons, so the first 2 fill the $1s$ orbital, the next 2 fill the $2s$ orbital, and the remaining 4 electrons fill the $2p$ orbital.

# Hund’s Rule and Electronic Configurations of Atoms and Ions (up to Atomic Number 30)

## Hund’s Rule

**Hund's Rule** of maximum multiplicity states that:

- In degenerate orbitals (orbitals of the same energy level, such as the $p$, $d$, and $f$ orbitals), electrons will first fill all the orbitals singly, with parallel spins, before pairing up.
- This minimizes the repulsion between electrons, making the atom more stable.

### Example:

Consider the $p$ orbitals. If an atom has 3 electrons to place in the $p$ orbitals (which have three degenerate orbitals), Hund's Rule tells us that the electrons will occupy each orbital singly with parallel spins, rather than pairing up.

For example, for the nitrogen atom (atomic number 7), the electron configuration is:

$$
1s^2 2s^2 2p^3
$$

Here, the $2p$ orbitals are filled with one electron in each orbital, following Hund's Rule.

## Electronic Configuration of Atoms (up to Atomic Number 30)

The electronic configuration of an atom describes the arrangement of electrons in the atom's orbitals.

The order in which electrons fill orbitals is based on the **Aufbau principle**, **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, and **Hund’s Rule**.

### General Order of Filling Orbitals:

The general order of filling orbitals is as follows, based on increasing energy:

$$
1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 3d < 4p < 5s < 4d < 5p < 6s < 4f < 5d < 6p < 7s
$$

# Quantitative Aspect (Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis)

---

## Introduction

The **quantitative aspect of electrolysis** involves calculating the amount of substance produced at the electrodes during electrolysis. This is governed by **Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis**, which relate the amount of chemical change at an electrode to the quantity of electric charge passed through the electrolyte.

## Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis

### 1. **Faraday's First Law of Electrolysis**

The first law states that:

> **The mass of a substance deposited or liberated at an electrode is directly proportional to the quantity of charge passed through the electrolyte.**

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
m \propto Q
$$

where:

- $m$ is the mass of the substance deposited or liberated at the electrode,
- $Q$ is the quantity of charge passed (in coulombs).

The relationship can be written as:

$$
m = \dfrac{M \cdot Q}{n \cdot F}
$$

where:

- $M$ is the molar mass of the substance,
- $n$ is the number of electrons involved in the reaction (i.e., the valency of the ion being reduced or oxidized),
- $F$ is **Faraday's constant** ($F \approx 96,485 \, \text{C/mol}$).

### 2. **Faraday's Second Law of Electrolysis**

The second law states that:

> **The masses of different substances deposited or liberated by the same quantity of charge are proportional to their equivalent masses.**

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\dfrac{m_1}{m_2} = \dfrac{E_1}{E_2}
$$

where:

- $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of substances 1 and 2 deposited or liberated,
- $E_1$ and $E_2$ are their equivalent masses (molar mass divided by the valency, $E = M/n$).

This law enables the comparison of the mass of substances involved in different electrolysis reactions using the same quantity of charge.

## Faraday's Constant and Quantitative Calculations

Faraday's constant ($F$) is a key constant in electrolysis calculations. It represents the charge on one mole of electrons:

$$
F = 96,485 \, \text{C/mol}
$$

Thus, **1 mole of electrons** corresponds to a charge of $96,485 \, \text{coulombs}$. This constant is used to calculate the amount of substance deposited or liberated during electrolysis, given the charge passed through the system.

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Electrolysis of Water

Calculate the mass of hydrogen gas produced at the cathode when a current of 2 A is passed for 1 hour during the electrolysis of water.

- Given:

  - Current ($I$) = 2 A
  - Time ($t$) = 1 hour = 3600 s
  - Molar mass of hydrogen ($M_H$) = 2 g/mol
  - The number of electrons involved in the reduction of hydrogen ions ($n$) = 2 (since each molecule of hydrogen gas requires 2 electrons)

- Step 1: Calculate the charge passed ($Q$):

$$
Q = I \cdot t = 2 \, \text{A} \cdot 3600 \, \text{s} = 7200 \, \text{C}
$$

- Step 2: Use Faraday's first law to calculate the mass of hydrogen gas produced:

$$
m = \dfrac{M \cdot Q}{n \cdot F} = \dfrac{2 \cdot 7200}{2 \cdot 96,485} \approx 0.0747 \, \text{g}
$$

Thus, **0.0747 grams of hydrogen gas** are produced.

### Example 2: Electrolysis of Copper Sulfate Solution

Calculate the mass of copper deposited at the cathode during the electrolysis of copper sulfate (CuSO₄) with a current of 3 A passed for 2 hours.

- Given:

  - Current ($I$) = 3 A
  - Time ($t$) = 2 hours = 7200 s
  - Molar mass of copper ($M_{Cu}$) = 63.5 g/mol
  - Number of electrons involved in the reduction of copper ions ($n$) = 2

- Step 1: Calculate the charge passed ($Q$):

$$
Q = I \cdot t = 3 \, \text{A} \cdot 7200 \, \text{s} = 21,600 \, \text{C}
$$

- Step 2: Use Faraday's first law to calculate the mass of copper deposited:

$$
m = \dfrac{M \cdot Q}{n \cdot F} = \dfrac{63.5 \cdot 21,600}{2 \cdot 96,485} \approx 42.0 \, \text{g}
$$

Thus, **42 grams of copper** are deposited at the cathode.

## Applications of Faraday's Laws

1. **Electroplating**: Faraday's laws are used to determine the amount of metal that will be deposited in electroplating processes.
2. **Electrorefining**: These laws help calculate the amount of pure metal obtained by electrorefining of ores.
3. **Manufacture of Chemicals**: Electrolysis is used in the production of chlorine, hydrogen, and sodium hydroxide from brine.

## Summary

Faraday's laws of electrolysis provide a quantitative understanding of the relationship between the amount of substance deposited at the electrodes and the quantity of charge passed through the electrolyte. These laws are essential for practical applications of electrolysis, such as electroplating, electrorefining, and chemical manufacturing.

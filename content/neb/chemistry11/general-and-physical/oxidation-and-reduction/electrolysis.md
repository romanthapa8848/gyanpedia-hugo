# Electrolysis

---

## Introduction

**Electrolysis** is the process of using electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction. It occurs in an **electrolytic cell**, where an external electric current is passed through an electrolyte, causing chemical reactions at the electrodes.

---

## Electrolytic Cell

An **electrolytic cell** consists of two electrodes: the **cathode** and the **anode**, which are submerged in an electrolyte solution. The electrolyte contains free ions that can move under the influence of the electric current.

- **Cathode**: The electrode where **reduction** (gain of electrons) occurs. It is negatively charged.
- **Anode**: The electrode where **oxidation** (loss of electrons) occurs. It is positively charged.

---

## Process of Electrolysis

When electric current is passed through an electrolyte:

1. **Anions** (negative ions) move towards the anode, where they lose electrons (oxidation).
2. **Cations** (positive ions) move towards the cathode, where they gain electrons (reduction).

## Faraday’s Laws of Electrolysis

The laws governing electrolysis are formulated by Michael Faraday:

### 1. **Faraday’s First Law**:

The amount of substance deposited or liberated at an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of electric charge passed through the electrolyte.

$$
m = Z \cdot Q
$$

Where:

- $m$ is the mass of the substance deposited or liberated.
- $Z$ is the electrochemical equivalent (a constant for the substance).
- $Q$ is the total charge passed, which is the product of current and time: $Q = I \cdot t$.

### 2. **Faraday’s Second Law**:

The amount of different substances deposited or liberated by the same quantity of electric charge is proportional to their equivalent weights.

$$
\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \frac{E_1}{E_2}
$$

Where:

- $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the substances deposited or liberated.
- $E_1$ and $E_2$ are their respective equivalent weights.

## Applications of Electrolysis

Electrolysis has many important applications, including:

1. **Electroplating**: Electrolytic process used to coat a metal object with a thin layer of another metal.
2. **Electrorefining of Metals**: Purification of metals like copper by removing impurities.
3. **Production of Chlorine and Sodium Hydroxide**: Electrolysis of brine ($NaCl$ solution) produces chlorine gas at the anode and sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas at the cathode.
4. **Electrosynthesis of Compounds**: Electrolysis is used in the synthesis of chemicals like hydrogen, oxygen, and various organic compounds.
5. **Extraction of Metals**: Electrolysis is used to extract reactive metals such as aluminium from their ores.

## Example of Electrolysis: Electrolysis of Water

When water ($H_2O$) is electrolyzed, it splits into hydrogen and oxygen gases:

### Reaction at the Cathode (Reduction):

$$
2H_2O + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2 + 2OH^-
$$

### Reaction at the Anode (Oxidation):

$$
4OH^- \rightarrow O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^-
$$

The overall reaction is:

$$
2H_2O \rightarrow 2H_2 + O_2
$$

Thus, water decomposes into hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode.

## Summary

**Electrolysis** is a technique used to drive non-spontaneous chemical reactions by passing an electric current through an electrolyte. The process is governed by **Faraday's laws**, and it has numerous applications, such as electroplating, electrorefining of metals, and the production of gases like hydrogen and oxygen.

Electrolysis is the process of using electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction, occurring in an electrolytic cell.

### 2. What are the two types of electrodes in an electrolytic cell?

The two types of electrodes are the **cathode** (where reduction occurs) and the **anode** (where oxidation occurs).

### 3. What is the role of an electrolyte in electrolysis?

The electrolyte is a solution that contains free ions, which conduct electricity and participate in the redox reactions at the electrodes.

### 4. What is the significance of Faraday’s laws in electrolysis?

Faraday’s laws provide the mathematical foundation for calculating the amount of substance deposited or liberated during electrolysis.

### 5. What happens at the cathode during electrolysis?

At the cathode, **reduction** takes place, where cations (positive ions) gain electrons to become neutral atoms or molecules.

### 6. What happens at the anode during electrolysis?

At the anode, **oxidation** occurs, where anions (negative ions) lose electrons to form neutral atoms or molecules.

### 7. How does electrolysis of water work?

Electrolysis of water splits water molecules into hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode.

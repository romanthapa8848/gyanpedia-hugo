# General and Electronic Concept of Oxidation and Reduction

## General Concept of Oxidation and Reduction

**Oxidation** and **reduction** are chemical reactions that always occur together. These reactions are referred to as **redox reactions**.

- **Oxidation** is the process in which an atom, ion, or molecule **loses electrons**.
- **Reduction** is the process in which an atom, ion, or molecule **gains electrons**.

The two processes always occur simultaneously because the electrons lost in oxidation are gained in reduction. A simple way to remember is that **"LEO goes GER"**, where:

- **LEO**: Loss of Electrons is Oxidation
- **GER**: Gain of Electrons is Reduction

## Oxidizing and Reducing Agents

In a redox reaction, there are two important agents:

1. **Oxidizing Agent** (Oxidant): The substance that **gains electrons** and is **reduced**.
2. **Reducing Agent** (Reductant): The substance that **loses electrons** and is **oxidized**.

For example, in the reaction between zinc and copper sulfate:
$$ \text{Zn (s)} + \text{CuSO}\_4 \text{ (aq)} \rightarrow \text{ZnSO}\_4 \text{ (aq)} + \text{Cu (s)} $$

- Zinc (Zn) loses electrons, so it is **oxidized** and is the **reducing agent**.
- Copper ion (Cu²⁺) gains electrons, so it is **reduced** and is the **oxidizing agent**.

## Electronic Concept of Oxidation and Reduction

### Oxidation (Electron Loss)

- **Oxidation** can be viewed at the electronic level as the **loss of electrons** by an atom or ion.
- As a result of losing electrons, the oxidation state of the atom or ion **increases**.

For example, in the oxidation of sodium:
$$ \text{Na} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ + e^- $$

- Sodium (Na) loses one electron to form Na⁺, and its oxidation state increases from 0 to +1.

### Reduction (Electron Gain)

- **Reduction** can be understood as the **gain of electrons** by an atom or ion.
- As a result of gaining electrons, the oxidation state of the atom or ion **decreases**.

For example, in the reduction of copper(II) ion:
$$ \text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu} $$

- Copper ion (Cu²⁺) gains two electrons to form neutral copper (Cu), and its oxidation state decreases from +2 to 0.

## Redox Reactions and Oxidation States

- Redox reactions involve the change in the oxidation states of the reactants.
- The substance that undergoes oxidation will show an **increase in oxidation state**, while the substance that undergoes reduction will show a **decrease in oxidation state**.

For example, in the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen:
$$ 2\text{H_2} + \text{O}\_2 \rightarrow 2\text{H}\_2\text{O} $$

- **Hydrogen** is oxidized from 0 to +1 (loses electrons).
- **Oxygen** is reduced from 0 to -2 (gains electrons).

## Summary

- **Oxidation** involves the **loss of electrons**, leading to an **increase in oxidation state**.
- **Reduction** involves the **gain of electrons**, leading to a **decrease in oxidation state**.
- These reactions always occur together in **redox reactions**, where one substance is oxidized and the other is reduced.
- The **oxidizing agent** gains electrons and is reduced, while the **reducing agent** loses electrons and is oxidized.

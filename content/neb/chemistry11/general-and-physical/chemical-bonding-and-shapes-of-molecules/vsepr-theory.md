# VSEPR Theory and Shapes of Simple Molecules

---

## Introduction to VSEPR Theory

The **Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory** is a model used to predict the geometry or shape of a molecule based on the number of electron pairs (bonding and lone pairs) around the central atom. According to this theory, electron pairs in the valence shell of an atom repel each other and arrange themselves in such a way that minimizes this repulsion. The repulsion between electron pairs determines the molecule's shape.

The main principles of VSEPR theory are:

1. Electron pairs in the valence shell of an atom will repel each other.
2. The electron pairs arrange themselves as far apart as possible to minimize repulsion.
3. The geometry of the molecule depends on the number of bonding and lone electron pairs around the central atom.

## Steps to Predict Molecular Shape Using VSEPR

1. **Count the total number of electron pairs (bonding and lone pairs) around the central atom.**
2. **Determine the electron pair geometry**, which is based on the total number of electron pairs.
3. **Account for the number of lone pairs** to predict the molecular shape.

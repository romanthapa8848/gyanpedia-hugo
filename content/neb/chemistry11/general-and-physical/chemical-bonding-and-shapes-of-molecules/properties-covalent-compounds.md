# Properties of Covalent Compounds

---

Covalent compounds are formed when atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. Unlike ionic compounds, covalent compounds display distinct physical and chemical properties due to the nature of the bonds between the atoms.

## 1. **Low Melting and Boiling Points**

Covalent compounds generally have low melting and boiling points compared to ionic compounds. This is because the forces between the molecules (known as intermolecular forces) are weaker than the forces holding ions together in ionic compounds. As a result, covalent compounds are often found in the **liquid** or **gas** state at room temperature.

- **Example**: Water (H₂O), methane (CH₄), and oxygen (O₂) are covalent compounds with relatively low melting and boiling points.

---

## 2. **Non-conductive in Solid, Liquid, or Aqueous States**

Covalent compounds typically do not conduct electricity in their solid, liquid, or aqueous forms. This is because they do not have free-moving charged particles like ions or electrons, which are necessary for electrical conductivity.

- **Example**: Sugar (C₆H₁₂O₆) dissolved in water does not conduct electricity because it lacks free-moving ions.

---

## 3. **Solubility in Polar and Non-polar Solvents**

Covalent compounds can be soluble in both **polar** and **non-polar solvents**, depending on their own polarity. **Polar covalent compounds** (like water) dissolve in **polar solvents** (like ethanol), while **non-polar covalent compounds** (like oils or fats) dissolve in **non-polar solvents** (like hexane).

- **Example**: Sugar (a polar covalent compound) dissolves in water, while oil (a non-polar covalent compound) dissolves in hexane.

---

## 4. **Poor Electrical Conductivity**

Since covalent compounds do not have ions or free electrons, they do not conduct electricity. This is in contrast to ionic compounds, which have free ions that can move and conduct electricity.

- **Example**: Both solid and liquid forms of covalent compounds like **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** and **methane (CH₄)** do not conduct electricity.

---

## 5. **Brittleness or Flexibility**

Covalent compounds can vary in their mechanical properties. Some are brittle (e.g., solid iodine crystals), while others, especially polymers, can be flexible. The flexibility depends on the nature of the bonds and the structure of the compound.

- **Example**: **Polyethylene (C₂H₄)** is a flexible polymer made of covalent bonds, while **diamond (C)**, despite being made of covalent bonds, is very hard and brittle.

---

## 6. **Volatility**

Many covalent compounds, especially small molecules, are **volatile**, meaning they can easily evaporate and turn into gases. This is because the intermolecular forces are weak, allowing molecules to escape into the air at lower temperatures.

- **Example**: **Acetone (C₃H₆O)**, a covalent compound, is highly volatile and evaporates quickly.

---

## 7. **Non-ionic Nature**

Unlike ionic compounds, which are made up of positively and negatively charged ions, covalent compounds do not dissociate into ions in solution. Instead, they retain their molecular integrity in solution.

- **Example**: **Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)** dissolves in water as whole molecules rather than dissociating into ions.

---

## 8. **Directionality of Bonding**

Covalent bonds have **directional nature**, meaning they have specific orientations in space. This directional nature leads to the formation of well-defined shapes and structures in covalent compounds.

- **Example**: The **tetrahedral structure** of methane (CH₄) is due to the directional nature of covalent bonds.

---

## Summary

Covalent compounds possess distinct properties due to the nature of their bonding. They generally have low melting and boiling points, poor electrical conductivity, and a variety of solubility behaviors depending on their polarity. Their weak intermolecular forces contribute to their volatility and non-ionic nature.

## FAQs

### 1. Why do covalent compounds have low melting and boiling points?

Covalent compounds have low melting and boiling points because the intermolecular forces holding the molecules together are weak compared to the ionic bonds in ionic compounds.

### 2. Do covalent compounds conduct electricity?

Covalent compounds do not conduct electricity because they do not contain free-moving ions or electrons.

### 3. What determines the solubility of covalent compounds?

The solubility of covalent compounds depends on the polarity of the molecules and the solvent. Polar covalent compounds dissolve in polar solvents, and non-polar covalent compounds dissolve in non-polar solvents.

### 4. Why are covalent compounds generally not conductive?

Covalent compounds lack free-moving ions or electrons that are necessary for electrical conductivity.

### 5. Are covalent compounds always non-polar?

No, covalent compounds can be either polar or non-polar, depending on the difference in electronegativity between the bonded atoms.

### 6. What is meant by the volatility of a covalent compound?

Volatility refers to a substance's tendency to vaporize. Covalent compounds, especially small molecules, tend to be volatile due to weak intermolecular forces.

### 7. What is the mechanical behavior of covalent compounds?

Covalent compounds can be either brittle (e.g., iodine crystals) or flexible (e.g., polyethylene), depending on their molecular structure.

### 8. Do covalent compounds dissociate in solution?

No, covalent compounds do not dissociate into ions in solution. Instead, they retain their molecular form.

### 9. Why are covalent bonds directional?

Covalent bonds are directional because they involve the overlap of atomic orbitals, leading to specific bond angles and molecular shapes.

### 10. Can covalent compounds be metals?

No, covalent bonding occurs between non-metals. Metals typically form metallic bonds, which are different from covalent bonds.

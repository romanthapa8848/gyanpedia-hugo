# Surface Tension and Viscosity

---

## Surface Tension

### Definition

**Surface tension** is a property of liquids where the surface behaves like a stretched elastic membrane. It results from cohesive forces between liquid molecules, creating a minimized surface area.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Cohesive Forces**: Molecules at the surface experience a net inward force due to attraction from molecules below, causing the surface to contract.
2. **Minimization of Surface Area**: The liquid tends to reduce its surface area, resulting in a spherical shape for droplets, which has the smallest possible surface area for a given volume.

### Factors Affecting Surface Tension

- **Temperature**: Increasing temperature reduces surface tension, as higher kinetic energy weakens the cohesive forces.
- **Impurities**: Adding substances, like soap, can decrease surface tension by disrupting the cohesive forces.

### Examples of Surface Tension

- **Water Droplets**: Water forms spherical droplets due to surface tension.
- **Floating of Insects**: Some insects, like water striders, can walk on water due to surface tension.
- **Meniscus in a Tube**: Water in a tube forms a curved surface due to the interplay of cohesive and adhesive forces.

## Viscosity

### Definition

**Viscosity** is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. It arises from internal friction between layers of the liquid moving at different speeds, influenced by molecular interactions within the liquid.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Internal Friction**: Molecules within a fluid exert resistance to movement, making it harder for layers to slide past each other.
2. **Flow Resistance**: Higher viscosity means the liquid flows more slowly, while low viscosity means it flows easily.

### Factors Affecting Viscosity

- **Temperature**: For liquids, viscosity decreases with an increase in temperature, as molecules move more freely. For gases, viscosity increases with temperature.
- **Molecular Structure**: Larger or more complex molecules tend to have higher viscosity due to increased internal friction.

### Examples of Viscosity

- **Honey vs. Water**: Honey has a much higher viscosity than water, making it flow more slowly.
- **Motor Oil**: Different viscosities of motor oil are chosen for engines based on temperature conditions.
- **Lava Flow**: Viscosity determines the flow rate of lava; higher viscosity results in a slower flow.

## Summary

- **Surface Tension**: A property due to cohesive forces, causing liquid surfaces to minimize their area, resulting in phenomena like spherical droplets and the ability for light objects to float on water.
- **Viscosity**: A measure of a liquid’s resistance to flow, determined by molecular interactions within the liquid, affecting how easily it flows.

## FAQs

### 1. What causes surface tension?

Surface tension is caused by cohesive forces between molecules at the surface of a liquid, creating a contracted surface layer.

### 2. Why do water droplets form a spherical shape?

Water droplets form a spherical shape because surface tension minimizes the surface area, resulting in a round shape.

### 3. How does temperature affect surface tension?

Increasing temperature reduces surface tension as it weakens the cohesive forces between molecules.

### 4. What is viscosity?

Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow, caused by internal friction between its molecules.

### 5. Why is honey more viscous than water?

Honey is more viscous because of its larger and more complex molecules, creating higher internal friction.

### 6. Does viscosity change with temperature?

Yes, viscosity decreases with increasing temperature in liquids, making them flow more easily.

### 7. How does surface tension help insects walk on water?

Insects like water striders rely on surface tension to stay on the surface, as it creates a strong enough layer to support their weight.

### 8. Why does lava with high viscosity flow slowly?

High viscosity lava flows slowly because of greater resistance to movement between its layers.

### 9. Can gases have viscosity?

Yes, gases have viscosity, and it increases with temperature.

### 10. How does soap affect the surface tension of water?

Soap decreases water's surface tension by disrupting the cohesive forces among water molecules.

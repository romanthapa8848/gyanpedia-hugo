# Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure

---

## Introduction

Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, proposed by John Dalton in 1801, describes the behavior of a mixture of non-reacting gases. According to this law, each gas in a mixture of gases exerts its own pressure independently of the others. This means that the total pressure exerted by a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases.

## Statement of Dalton’s Law

Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures states:

**“The total pressure exerted by a mixture of non-reacting gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each gas in the mixture.”**

Mathematically, the law can be written as:

$$
P_{\text{total}} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \dots + P_n
$$

where:

- $P_{\text{total}}$ is the total pressure exerted by the gas mixture,
- $P_1, P_2, P_3, \dots, P_n$ are the partial pressures of the individual gases in the mixture.

## Explanation of Partial Pressure

Each gas in a mixture behaves as if it were alone in the container. The partial pressure of a gas is the pressure exerted by that gas alone in the same volume and at the same temperature. It depends on the number of moles of the gas and the conditions of the system (such as temperature and volume).

For an ideal gas, the partial pressure can be calculated using **Dalton’s Law** and the ideal gas law. The ideal gas law is given by:

$$
P V = n R T
$$

where:

- $P$ is the pressure of the gas,
- $V$ is the volume,
- $n$ is the number of moles,
- $R$ is the ideal gas constant,
- $T$ is the temperature.

## Derivation of Dalton’s Law

Consider a mixture of two non-reacting ideal gases, gas 1 and gas 2, in a fixed volume at a constant temperature. Each gas exerts a pressure due to its own molecules, and the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the two gases.

For gas 1, according to the ideal gas law:

$$
P_1 V = n_1 R T
$$

For gas 2, similarly:

$$
P_2 V = n_2 R T
$$

Since the volume, temperature, and gas constant are constant for both gases, we can write:

$$
P_1 = \frac{n_1 R T}{V}
$$

$$
P_2 = \frac{n_2 R T}{V}
$$

The total pressure exerted by the gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures:

$$
P_{\text{total}} = P_1 + P_2 = \frac{n_1 R T}{V} + \frac{n_2 R T}{V}
$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$
P_{\text{total}} = \frac{R T}{V} (n_1 + n_2)
$$

Thus, Dalton’s Law is derived from the ideal gas law for the mixture of two gases. It can be extended to more gases in a mixture.

## Applications of Dalton’s Law

1. **In Gas Mixtures**: Dalton’s Law helps in determining the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases when the individual partial pressures are known. This is particularly useful in systems such as air mixtures, combustion processes, and chemical reactions involving gases.

2. **In Respiratory Systems**: The law is important in understanding the behavior of gases in the human body, such as the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs and bloodstream.

3. **In Chemical Reactions**: When gases are involved in reactions, Dalton’s Law allows for the prediction of total pressure changes, particularly in reactions that involve multiple gases.

## Summary

Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures states that the total pressure exerted by a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases. This law is based on the assumption that each gas behaves independently and does not interact chemically with other gases in the mixture. The law has various practical applications, especially in understanding the behavior of gas mixtures in both natural and industrial processes.

## FAQs

### 1. What is Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressure?

Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressure states that the total pressure exerted by a mixture of non-reacting gases is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas in the mixture.

### 2. How do you calculate the partial pressure of a gas in a mixture?

The partial pressure of a gas can be calculated using the ideal gas law, $P = \frac{n R T}{V}$, where $n$ is the number of moles of the gas.

### 3. Can Dalton’s Law be applied to reactive gases?

Dalton’s Law is applicable only to non-reacting gases. For reactive gases, the chemical reactions must be considered.

### 4. How is Dalton’s Law used in determining the total pressure of a gas mixture?

The total pressure of a gas mixture is simply the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases, which can be calculated using the ideal gas law.

### 5. What is the formula for Dalton’s Law?

The formula for Dalton’s Law is:

$$
P_{\text{total}} = P_1 + P_2 + \dots + P_n
$$

where $P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n$ are the partial pressures of the individual gases.

### 6. Does Dalton’s Law apply to real gases?

Dalton’s Law is derived for ideal gases, but it also applies approximately to real gases at low pressures and high temperatures, where the gases behave more ideally.

### 7. How is Dalton’s Law used in the atmosphere?

Dalton’s Law helps determine the partial pressures of gases like oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere, which are important for understanding weather patterns and human respiration.

### 8. Can Dalton’s Law be applied in chemical engineering?

Yes, Dalton’s Law is frequently used in chemical engineering to determine the behavior of gas mixtures in processes such as distillation and reactions.

### 9. What is the significance of partial pressure in Dalton’s Law?

Partial pressure is the pressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture, and it helps determine the overall pressure exerted by the mixture.

### 10. What happens when gases in a mixture react with each other?

When gases react chemically, Dalton’s Law does not apply directly. The partial pressures of reactants and products need to be accounted for, and stoichiometry must be used to determine the changes in pressure.

# Molecular Mass and Number of Particles

**Molecular mass** is the mass of a molecule and is determined by summing the atomic masses of all the atoms present in the molecule. Molecular mass is typically expressed in atomic mass units (amu) or grams per mole (g/mol).

**Number of particles** refers to the count of atoms, ions, or molecules in a given sample of a substance. This number is often determined using **Avogadro's number** ($6.022 \times 10^{23}$), which is the number of particles in one mole of any substance.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Molecular Mass

Molecular mass can be calculated by adding up the atomic masses of each atom in a molecule. For example, in water ($H_2O$):

$$
\text{Molecular Mass of H}_2\text{O} = (2 \times 1) + (1 \times 16) = 18 \text{ amu}
$$

### 2. Avogadro's Number and Moles

One mole of any substance contains exactly $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles, which is Avogadro's number. Thus:

$$
\text{Number of particles} = \text{moles} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}
$$

### 3. Relation Between Molecular Mass and Number of Particles

To find the number of molecules in a sample, you first calculate the moles of the substance and then use Avogadro's number. For example, if you have a 36 g sample of water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$):

1. **Calculate moles**:
   $$
   \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molecular mass}} = \frac{36 \text{ g}}{18 \text{ g/mol}} = 2 \text{ moles}
   $$
2. **Calculate number of molecules**:
   $$
   \text{Number of molecules} = 2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 1.2044 \times 10^{24} \text{ molecules}
   $$

## Summary

- **Molecular Mass** is the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule.
- **Avogadro’s Number** is $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles per mole.
- The formula for calculating the number of particles is:
  $$
  \text{Number of particles} = \text{moles} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}
  $$

## FAQs

### 1. What is molecular mass?

Molecular mass is the total mass of all atoms in a molecule, measured in atomic mass units (amu) or grams per mole (g/mol).

### 2. How many particles are in 1 mole of a substance?

One mole contains $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles, which is Avogadro's number.

### 3. How do you calculate the number of molecules in a sample?

First, determine the number of moles, then multiply by Avogadro’s number to get the number of molecules.

### 4. What is the significance of Avogadro's number?

Avogadro's number defines the quantity of particles in one mole, establishing a bridge between atomic and macroscopic scales.

### 5. How does molecular mass relate to the number of particles?

Molecular mass allows you to determine the number of moles from a given mass, which can then be converted to the number of particles.

### 6. Can molecular mass vary for different molecules?

Yes, molecular mass varies as it depends on the specific atoms and structure of each molecule.

### 7. How does Avogadro’s number apply to atoms and ions?

Avogadro’s number applies to all entities (atoms, molecules, ions) in a mole, regardless of their type.

### 8. What is the molecular mass of $CO_2$?

The molecular mass of $CO_2$ is 44 amu, based on its atomic composition.

### 9. Does Avogadro's number change with the substance?

No, Avogadro's number is a constant and applies universally to all substances.

### 10. What units are used for molecular mass?

Molecular mass is expressed in atomic mass units (amu) or grams per mole (g/mol).

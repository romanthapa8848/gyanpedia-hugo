# Solubility of Hydroxides, Carbonates, and Sulphates of Alkaline Earth Metals

## General Trends

The solubility of hydroxides, carbonates, and sulphates of alkaline earth metals (Group 2 elements) shows distinct trends across the group. These trends are influenced by the size and charge of the metal cation, as well as the lattice energy and hydration energy of the resulting compounds.

### 1. **Solubility of Hydroxides**

- **Trend**: The solubility of hydroxides of alkaline earth metals increases as you move down the group from **Be(OH)₂** to **Ba(OH)₂**.
  
- **Explanation**: 
  - **Beryllium hydroxide (Be(OH)₂)** is insoluble in water, forming a gel-like precipitate, due to the high lattice energy and small ionic radius of **Be²⁺**. 
  - As we move down the group, the ionic size increases, making the lattice energy lower, and thus, the hydroxides become more soluble. **Ba(OH)₂** is highly soluble in water.
  
### 2. **Solubility of Carbonates**

- **Trend**: The solubility of carbonates of alkaline earth metals decreases as you move down the group from **BeCO₃** to **BaCO₃**.
  
- **Explanation**: 
  - **Beryllium carbonate (BeCO₃)** is soluble in water due to the small **Be²⁺** ion and its ability to interact with water molecules.
  - However, as the size of the cation increases down the group, the lattice energy of the carbonates increases, making them less soluble. **BaCO₃** is almost insoluble in water.

### 3. **Solubility of Sulphates**

- **Trend**: The solubility of sulphates of alkaline earth metals shows an anomalous trend. The solubility increases from **BeSO₄** to **CaSO₄**, but decreases from **SrSO₄** to **BaSO₄**.
  
- **Explanation**: 
  - **BeSO₄** and **MgSO₄** are highly soluble in water due to the smaller size of **Be²⁺** and **Mg²⁺**, which results in lower lattice energy.
  - **CaSO₄** is sparingly soluble in water, and **SrSO₄** and **BaSO₄** are almost insoluble due to the increasing lattice energy as the ionic size increases. The larger the cation, the less soluble the sulphate becomes due to the low hydration energy of the larger ions.

## Summary

The solubility trends of hydroxides, carbonates, and sulphates of alkaline earth metals are governed by the balance between lattice energy and hydration energy. Hydroxides become more soluble down the group, while carbonates become less soluble. Sulphates show an anomalous trend, being highly soluble for Be and Mg, less soluble for Ca, and almost insoluble for Sr and Ba.

## FAQs

### 1. Why do alkaline earth metal hydroxides become more soluble down the group?
The solubility increases because the ionic size increases, resulting in lower lattice energy, making it easier for water molecules to dissociate the hydroxide.

### 2. Why is beryllium hydroxide insoluble in water?
Beryllium hydroxide is insoluble due to its high lattice energy and small ionic size, which makes it difficult for water molecules to break the ionic bonds.

### 3. What is the trend in the solubility of alkaline earth metal carbonates?
The solubility of carbonates decreases as you move down the group due to the increasing lattice energy of the carbonates as the ionic size increases.

### 4. Which alkaline earth metal carbonate is soluble in water?
**Beryllium carbonate (BeCO₃)** is soluble in water, unlike the other carbonates in the group.

### 5. Why does the solubility of sulphates decrease after calcium sulphate?
The solubility decreases because of the increasing lattice energy of the sulphates as the ionic size increases, making it harder for the ions to dissociate in water.

### 6. Which alkaline earth metal sulphate is most soluble in water?
**Magnesium sulphate (MgSO₄)** is the most soluble sulphate in water.

### 7. Why is calcium sulphate sparingly soluble in water?
Calcium sulphate has an intermediate ionic size, resulting in moderate lattice energy, which makes it only sparingly soluble.

### 8. Which alkaline earth metal hydroxide is the most soluble?
**Barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂)** is the most soluble hydroxide in water.

### 9. Why is magnesium sulphate more soluble than calcium sulphate?
Magnesium sulphate is more soluble because **Mg²⁺** has a smaller ionic radius compared to **Ca²⁺**, resulting in lower lattice energy.

### 10. What is the solubility trend of sulphates from BeSO₄ to BaSO₄?
The solubility increases from **BeSO₄** to **CaSO₄** but decreases from **SrSO₄** to **BaSO₄** due to the increasing lattice energy down the group.

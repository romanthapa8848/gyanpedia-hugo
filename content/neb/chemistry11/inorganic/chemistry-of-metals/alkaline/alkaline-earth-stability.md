# Stability of Carbonates and Nitrates of Alkaline Earth Metals

## General Trends

The stability of **carbonates** and **nitrates** of alkaline earth metals (Group 2 elements) varies as we move down the group. This trend is influenced by factors such as the size of the metal cation, lattice energy, and the ability of the metal to stabilize the anion (carbonate or nitrate).

### 1. **Stability of Carbonates**

- **Trend**: The stability of the carbonates increases as we move down the group from **BeCO₃** to **BaCO₃**.
  
- **Explanation**:
  - **Beryllium carbonate (BeCO₃)** is unstable and decomposes easily upon heating to form **BeO** and **CO₂**. This is due to the small size and high charge density of the **Be²⁺** ion, which results in a high lattice energy, making it harder to stabilize the carbonate anion.
  - As the ionic size of the alkaline earth metals increases (from **Be²⁺** to **Ba²⁺**), the lattice energy decreases. This makes the carbonates more stable. **BaCO₃** is quite stable and does not decompose easily upon heating.

### 2. **Stability of Nitrates**

- **Trend**: The stability of the nitrates decreases as we move down the group from **Be(NO₃)₂** to **Ba(NO₃)₂**.
  
- **Explanation**:
  - **Beryllium nitrate (Be(NO₃)₂)** is highly stable at room temperature but decomposes at higher temperatures into **BeO**, **NO₂**, and **O₂**. This is due to the small size and high charge density of **Be²⁺**, which leads to strong electrostatic attraction between the cation and nitrate ion, making the nitrate stable at lower temperatures but prone to decomposition at higher temperatures.
  - As we go down the group, the ionic size of the alkaline earth metals increases, leading to weaker electrostatic attractions between the metal cation and the nitrate anion. As a result, the nitrates become less stable, and decomposition occurs at lower temperatures. **Ba(NO₃)₂**, for instance, decomposes readily into **BaO**, **NO₂**, and **O₂** when heated.

## Summary

The stability of **carbonates** of alkaline earth metals increases down the group, as the larger cations (like **Ba²⁺**) stabilize the carbonate anion. On the other hand, the stability of **nitrates** decreases down the group because of weaker electrostatic attractions between the metal cations and nitrate ions as the ionic radius increases.

## FAQs

### 1. Why are beryllium carbonates unstable?
Beryllium carbonates are unstable due to the high lattice energy of **Be²⁺**, which makes it difficult to stabilize the carbonate anion.

### 2. Which carbonate of alkaline earth metals is the most stable?
**Barium carbonate (BaCO₃)** is the most stable carbonate of alkaline earth metals.

### 3. Why does the stability of nitrates decrease down the group?
As the ionic size of the cations increases, the electrostatic attraction between the metal cation and the nitrate anion becomes weaker, making the nitrates less stable.

### 4. Which alkaline earth metal nitrate is the least stable?
**Barium nitrate (Ba(NO₃)₂)** is the least stable nitrate and decomposes easily upon heating.

### 5. Why does beryllium nitrate decompose at higher temperatures?
Beryllium nitrate decomposes at high temperatures because **Be²⁺** has a high charge density, which causes the nitrate ion to become unstable at elevated temperatures.

### 6. Which carbonate decomposes at the lowest temperature?
**Beryllium carbonate (BeCO₃)** decomposes at the lowest temperature due to the instability of the carbonate anion.

### 7. What happens when **BaCO₃** is heated?
**BaCO₃** is stable and does not decompose easily when heated, unlike the carbonates of lighter alkaline earth metals.

### 8. Which alkaline earth metal nitrate is most stable at room temperature?
**Beryllium nitrate (Be(NO₃)₂)** is the most stable nitrate at room temperature but decomposes when heated.

### 9. Why are the carbonates of alkaline earth metals more stable down the group?
The stability increases down the group because the lattice energy of the carbonates decreases as the ionic size increases, making it easier to stabilize the carbonate anion.

### 10. What is the trend in the decomposition of nitrates from Be to Ba?
The nitrates decompose more easily as we go down the group, with **Ba(NO₃)₂** decomposing more readily than **Be(NO₃)₂**.

# General Characteristics of Alkaline Earth Metals

Alkaline earth metals are the elements found in Group 2 of the periodic table. They include **beryllium (Be)**, **magnesium (Mg)**, **calcium (Ca)**, **strontium (Sr)**, **barium (Ba)**, and **radium (Ra)**. These metals share several general characteristics, both physical and chemical, that distinguish them from other metals.

## Physical Properties

### 1. **Shiny Appearance**:
   Alkaline earth metals are shiny, silvery-white metals with a metallic luster.

### 2. **Relatively Low Melting and Boiling Points**:
   These metals have relatively low melting and boiling points compared to transition metals, though these increase down the group.

### 3. **Density**:
   The density of alkaline earth metals is typically low but increases down the group. Beryllium and magnesium have lower densities than calcium, strontium, and barium.

### 4. **Hardness**:
   Alkaline earth metals are harder than alkali metals but softer than transition metals. They are also malleable and ductile.

### 5. **Good Conductors of Heat and Electricity**:
   These metals are good conductors of both heat and electricity.

### 6. **Color of Flames**:
   When burned, alkaline earth metals produce characteristic flame colors:
   - **Calcium**: Orange-red flame
   - **Strontium**: Red flame
   - **Barium**: Green flame

## Chemical Properties

### 1. **Reactivity**:
   Alkaline earth metals are highly reactive, although less reactive than alkali metals. Their reactivity increases as you move down the group, with barium being the most reactive.

### 2. **Reaction with Water**:
   Alkaline earth metals react with water to form **hydroxides** and **hydrogen gas**. However, the reaction becomes more vigorous as you go down the group:
   - **Beryllium** reacts very slowly with water.
   - **Magnesium** reacts slowly with water but more quickly with steam.
   - **Calcium, Strontium, and Barium** react more vigorously with water, producing more heat.

   - **Example Reaction (Calcium with Water)**:
     $$ \text{Ca (s)} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O (l)} \rightarrow \text{Ca(OH)}_2 (aq) + \text{H}_2 (g) $$

### 3. **Formation of Oxides and Hydroxides**:
   Alkaline earth metals readily form **oxides** when exposed to oxygen. These oxides are basic in nature and can form hydroxides when dissolved in water.
   - **Example**: 
     $$ \text{Ca (s)} + \text{O}_2 (g) \rightarrow \text{CaO (s)} $$

   The hydroxides formed are strong bases, with solubility increasing down the group.

### 4. **Formation of Halides**:
   Alkaline earth metals react with halogens to form **ionic halides**. These compounds are typically white solids.
   - **Example**:
     $$ \text{Ca (s)} + \text{Cl}_2 (g) \rightarrow \text{CaCl}_2 (s) $$

### 5. **Basic Nature of Compounds**:
   The compounds of alkaline earth metals, including oxides, hydroxides, and carbonates, tend to be basic in nature. Their basicity increases down the group, with **barium hydroxide** being more basic than **beryllium hydroxide**.

### 6. **Ionization Energy**:
   The first ionization energies of alkaline earth metals are higher than those of alkali metals but decrease down the group. Beryllium has the highest first ionization energy, while radium has the lowest.

## Trends in Alkaline Earth Metals

- **Reactivity**: Reactivity increases as you move down the group.
- **Melting/Boiling Points**: Melting and boiling points decrease as you move down the group.
- **Ionization Energy**: First ionization energy decreases down the group.
- **Electronegativity**: Electronegativity decreases as you go down the group.

## Summary

Alkaline earth metals are a group of highly reactive metals with unique properties. They are shiny, good conductors of heat and electricity, and possess characteristic flame colors. Their reactivity increases down the group, and they readily form basic oxides, hydroxides, and halides. These metals play essential roles in various industrial and chemical applications.

# Phosphine (PH₃)

Phosphine (PH₃) is a colorless, flammable, and toxic gas that has a pungent odor similar to rotten fish. It is a hydride of phosphorus and exhibits significant chemical reactivity. Phosphine is an important compound in the chemistry of phosphorus and is used in various industrial applications.

## Preparation of Phosphine

Phosphine can be prepared in the laboratory by the following methods:

### 1. Reaction of White Phosphorus with Sodium Hydroxide

White phosphorus reacts with **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)** in the presence of water to produce phosphine:

$$
P_4 + 4 \text{NaOH} + 2 \text{H}_2O \rightarrow 2 \text{Na}_2HPO_4 + 2 \text{PH}_3
$$

### 2. Reaction of Phosphorus with Hydrogen

Phosphine is also prepared by passing hydrogen gas over heated phosphorus:

$$
P_4 + 6 \text{H}_2 \rightarrow 4 \text{PH}_3
$$

### 3. Reaction of Phosphine with Alkali Metals

Phosphine can be produced by the reaction of **alkali metals** like sodium or potassium with **phosphorus**:

$$
P_4 + 4 \text{Na} + 2 \text{H}_2O \rightarrow 2 \text{Na}_2HPO_4 + 2 \text{PH}_3
$$

## Properties of Phosphine

### 1. Basic Nature

Phosphine is a weak base. It can accept protons (H⁺) from acids but does so to a very limited extent:

$$
\text{PH}_3 + \text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{PH}_4^+
$$

- It does not dissolve well in water, and its aqueous solution has a slightly basic nature.

### 2. Reducing Nature

Phosphine is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce several metal oxides and halogens:

$$
\text{PH}_3 + 2 \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow \text{PCl}_3 + 3 \text{HCl}
$$

Phosphine reduces **mercury(II) chloride** to **mercury**:

$$
\text{PH}_3 + \text{HgCl}_2 \rightarrow \text{Hg} + 2 \text{HCl}
$$

### 3. Action with Halogens

Phosphine reacts with halogens (Cl₂, Br₂, I₂) to form **phosphorus trihalides** and **hydrogen halides**:

$$
\text{PH}_3 + 3 \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow \text{PCl}_3 + 3 \text{HCl}
$$

$$
\text{PH}_3 + 3 \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow \text{PBr}_3 + 3 \text{HBr}
$$

### 4. Action with Oxygen

Phosphine burns in oxygen to form **phosphorus pentoxide (P₄O₁₀)**:

$$
4 \text{PH}_3 + 4 \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{P}_4\text{O}_{10} + 6 \text{H}_2O
$$

Incomplete combustion can lead to the formation of **phosphorus trioxide (P₄O₆)**.

## Uses of Phosphine

Phosphine has a variety of uses in both industrial and agricultural applications:

1. **In the semiconductor industry**: Phosphine is used as a **dopant** for semiconductor materials like **gallium arsenide (GaAs)**.
  
2. **In the manufacture of phosphorus compounds**: Phosphine is used as an intermediate in the preparation of other phosphorus compounds, such as **phosphoric acid** and **phosphorus trichloride**.

3. **As a fumigant**: Phosphine is used as a **pest control agent** in **grain storage** and as a **fumigant** to kill rodents and insects.

4. **In the production of phosphine derivatives**: It is used in the production of chemicals like **phosphine oxide** and **phosphines** used as ligands in **organophosphorus chemistry**.

5. **In the production of phosphoric acid**: Phosphine is involved in the synthesis of **phosphoric acid**, which is widely used in fertilizers.

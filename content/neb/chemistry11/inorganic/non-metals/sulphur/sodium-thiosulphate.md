# Sodium Thiosulphate (Formula and Uses)

**Sodium Thiosulphate (Na₂S₂O₃)** is a white crystalline compound that is soluble in water. It has a variety of applications in industries like photography, medicine, and chemical synthesis. Sodium thiosulphate is known for its ability to neutralize chlorine and as a **dechlorinating agent**.

## Formula of Sodium Thiosulphate

The **chemical formula** of sodium thiosulphate is:
$$ \text{Na}_2\text{S}_2\text{O}_3 $$

It is commonly referred to as **sodium hyposulphite** or simply **hypo** in the photography industry.

## Uses of Sodium Thiosulphate

1. **Photography**
   - Sodium thiosulphate is used in **photographic processing** to **fix photographs**. It helps remove unreacted silver halide from exposed photographic films and papers, making the image permanent.
   - It is often referred to as a **fixing agent** in photographic processes.

2. **Dechlorination**
   - Sodium thiosulphate is used in water treatment to **neutralize chlorine**. It reacts with chlorine to form chloride ions, which is less toxic.
   $$ \text{Cl}_2 + \text{Na}_2\text{S}_2\text{O}_3 \rightarrow 2\text{NaCl} + \text{S}_2\text{O}_3^{2-} $$

3. **Medical Applications**
   - Sodium thiosulphate is used in medicine to treat **cyanide poisoning**. It reacts with cyanide ions to form **thiosulphate**, which is then excreted in the urine, helping to detoxify the body.
   $$ \text{Na}_2\text{S}_2\text{O}_3 + \text{CN}^- \rightarrow \text{NaSCN} + \text{Na}_2\text{S}_2\text{O}_3 $$

4. **Gold Extraction**
   - Sodium thiosulphate is used in the **extraction of gold** from its ores in gold mining. It serves as an alternative to cyanide in the **cyanidation process** for gold extraction.
   $$ \text{Au} + \text{Na}_2\text{S}_2\text{O}_3 \rightarrow \text{Na}_3\text{Au(S}_2\text{O}_3)_2 $$

5. **Antioxidant in Food Industry**
   - It is used in the **food industry** as an **antioxidant** to preserve the color of certain foods and to prevent browning in products like dried fruits.

6. **Analytical Chemistry**
   - Sodium thiosulphate is used in **titration** methods to determine the concentration of iodine or other halogens. It serves as a **reducing agent** in these reactions.

7. **Textile Industry**
   - In the textile industry, sodium thiosulphate is used as a **bleaching agent** and a **dechlorinating agent** to remove excess chlorine in fabric treatments.

8. **Disinfectant**
   - It is also used as a **disinfectant** in certain environments, especially in water treatment and in aquariums, to neutralize chlorine and other harmful chemicals.

9. **Chemical Synthesis**
   - Sodium thiosulphate plays a role in the **synthesis of various compounds**, including **sulfur** and **sulphuric acid**, and is used in different organic and inorganic reactions.

10. **Dyeing and Printing**
    - It is used in **dyeing and printing** processes, particularly in the **removal of unwanted colorants** or as a **scavenger for excess dye** in textiles.

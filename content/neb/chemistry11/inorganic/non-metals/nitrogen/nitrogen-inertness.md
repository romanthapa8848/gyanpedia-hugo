# Reason for Inertness of Nitrogen and Active Nitrogen

---

## Inertness of Nitrogen ($\text{N}_2$)

Nitrogen gas ($\text{N}_2$) is relatively inert due to the following reasons:

1. **Strong Triple Bond**: The most significant factor contributing to the inertness of nitrogen is its strong triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms. The bond dissociation energy of the $\text{N} \equiv \text{N}$ bond is very high (about 9.76 eV), making it extremely stable and difficult to break under normal conditions.

2. **Electron Pair Sharing**: In nitrogen molecules, both nitrogen atoms share three electrons, forming a very stable structure. This stable configuration makes it resistant to chemical reactions without significant energy input.

3. **Low Reactivity with Many Elements**: Nitrogen’s stable molecular structure makes it non-reactive with many elements, including oxygen, under standard conditions. It requires high energy, such as heat or an electrical discharge, to break the nitrogen-nitrogen bond and initiate reactions.

4. **Electron Configuration**: Nitrogen has an electron configuration of $1s^2 2s^2 2p^3$. The half-filled $2p$ orbitals contribute to its stability. As a result, nitrogen has little tendency to react unless a catalyst or high energy is involved.

## Active Nitrogen ($\text{N}$)

Active nitrogen refers to nitrogen atoms or species that are highly reactive due to the breaking of the $\text{N}_2$ bond, which can occur under specific conditions. These species include atomic nitrogen ($\text{N}$) and reactive nitrogen molecules like nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}$, $\text{NO}_2$). The reasons for the reactivity of active nitrogen include:

1. **Presence of Unpaired Electrons**: Active nitrogen atoms or molecules have unpaired electrons, making them highly reactive. For example, atomic nitrogen ($\text{N}$) has a single unpaired electron in its $2p$ orbital, which allows it to readily form bonds with other atoms or molecules.

2. **High Energy State**: Active nitrogen is typically created by high-energy processes such as electrical discharges, combustion, or the high-temperature reaction of nitrogen with oxygen. This energy excites the nitrogen atoms, giving them the ability to react with other molecules.

3. **Reactivity of Nitrogen Oxides**: Nitrogen oxides like nitrogen monoxide ($\text{NO}$) and nitrogen dioxide ($\text{NO}_2$) are examples of active nitrogen species. These compounds are highly reactive and play important roles in atmospheric chemistry, combustion, and pollution.

4. **Bonding with Oxygen**: Active nitrogen can easily react with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides like nitric oxide ($\text{NO}$) and nitrogen dioxide ($\text{NO}_2$), which are more reactive than nitrogen itself. For example:

   $$
   \text{N}_2 + \text{O}_2 \xrightarrow{heat} 2\text{NO}
   $$

   The formation of these reactive nitrogen oxides makes nitrogen more chemically active than its molecular form.

## Summary

- **Inertness of Nitrogen**: Nitrogen gas ($\text{N}_2$) is inert due to the strong triple bond between nitrogen atoms, which requires significant energy to break. Its stable electron configuration and the absence of readily available reactive electrons make it resistant to chemical reactions under normal conditions.

- **Active Nitrogen**: Active nitrogen refers to nitrogen species like atomic nitrogen and nitrogen oxides, which are highly reactive due to the breaking of the $\text{N}_2$ bond and the presence of unpaired electrons. Active nitrogen is formed under high-energy conditions and readily reacts with other substances, especially oxygen.

## FAQs

### 1. Why is nitrogen gas inert?

Nitrogen gas is inert because of its strong triple bond between nitrogen atoms, which requires a significant amount of energy to break, making it resistant to chemical reactions under normal conditions.

### 2. What makes active nitrogen reactive?

Active nitrogen is reactive because it contains unpaired electrons in its atomic or molecular form, which makes it highly reactive with other substances, particularly oxygen.

### 3. How is active nitrogen formed?

Active nitrogen is formed under high-energy conditions, such as electrical discharges, combustion, or high-temperature reactions, where the $\text{N}_2$ bond is broken and nitrogen atoms or reactive nitrogen oxides are produced.

### 4. What are nitrogen oxides, and why are they important?

Nitrogen oxides like nitric oxide ($\text{NO}$) and nitrogen dioxide ($\text{NO}_2$) are highly reactive compounds formed from active nitrogen. They play crucial roles in atmospheric chemistry, combustion, and pollution.

### 5. Why does nitrogen not easily react with oxygen?

Nitrogen does not easily react with oxygen because the $\text{N}_2$ molecule has a very strong triple bond that requires a high amount of energy to break, preventing easy interaction with oxygen under normal conditions.

### 6. Can active nitrogen bond with other elements?

Yes, active nitrogen can bond with oxygen and other elements to form nitrogen oxides and various reactive nitrogen compounds.

### 7. What role does temperature play in the reactivity of nitrogen?

High temperatures are often required to break the strong $\text{N}_2$ bond in nitrogen, making the molecule more reactive and allowing it to participate in reactions with other elements, such as oxygen.

### 8. How does active nitrogen contribute to pollution?

Active nitrogen, in the form of nitrogen oxides, contributes to air pollution by forming smog and acid rain, which can have harmful effects on human health and the environment.

### 9. What is the bond dissociation energy of the $\text{N}_2$ bond?

The bond dissociation energy of the $\text{N}_2$ bond is around 9.76 eV, which makes it one of the strongest covalent bonds and a key factor in the inertness of nitrogen.

### 10. How does atomic nitrogen differ from molecular nitrogen?

Atomic nitrogen is highly reactive and has unpaired electrons, while molecular nitrogen ($\text{N}_2$) is inert due to its strong triple bond and stable electron configuration.

# Physical Properties of Benzene

Benzene ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_6$) is a colorless, highly flammable liquid that is a widely used aromatic hydrocarbon in the chemical industry. In this section, we will discuss its key physical properties.

---

## 1. Appearance

Benzene is a colorless liquid with a distinctive sweet odor. It is volatile and has a high tendency to evaporate at room temperature.

---

## 2. Boiling Point

Benzene has a boiling point of **80.1°C**. This is relatively low compared to water, due to its non-polar nature and weak intermolecular forces, which makes it easier to vaporize.

---

## 3. Melting Point

The melting point of benzene is **5.5°C**. At this temperature, it transitions from a solid state (below 5.5°C) to a liquid state.

---

## 4. Density

Benzene has a density of **0.8765 g/cm³** at 20°C. It is less dense than water, which is why benzene floats on water.

---

## 5. Solubility

Benzene is **insoluble** in water but is soluble in organic solvents such as alcohol, ether, and chloroform. Its non-polar nature prevents it from dissolving in the polar water molecules.

---

## 6. Refractive Index

Benzene has a refractive index of **1.501**. This indicates how much light is bent when it passes through benzene.

---

## 7. Vapor Pressure

Benzene has a vapor pressure of **12.7 mm Hg** at 20°C. This indicates its tendency to evaporate at room temperature.

---

## 8. Color and Odor

As mentioned earlier, benzene is colorless and has a sweet odor. Its characteristic smell is quite potent, which makes it easily identifiable.

---

## 9. Flammability

Benzene is highly flammable and can catch fire easily. It forms explosive mixtures with air. Due to this property, it must be handled with care in both laboratory and industrial settings.

---

## 10. Thermal Stability

Benzene is thermally stable and does not decompose easily at normal temperatures. However, at very high temperatures (above 500°C), it can undergo pyrolysis.

---

## Summary

Benzene is a colorless, volatile liquid with a sweet odor. Its physical properties include a boiling point of 80.1°C, a melting point of 5.5°C, and a density of 0.8765 g/cm³. Benzene is insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents and is highly flammable. It has a refractive index of 1.501 and a vapor pressure of 12.7 mm Hg at room temperature.

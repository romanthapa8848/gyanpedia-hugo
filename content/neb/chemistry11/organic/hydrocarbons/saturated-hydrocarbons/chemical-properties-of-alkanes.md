# Chemical Properties of Alkanes

Alkanes undergo various chemical reactions. Some important ones include substitution reactions such as halogenation, nitration, and sulphonation. Another key reaction is the oxidation of ethane.

## 1. Substitution Reactions of Alkanes

### 1.1 Halogenation
Halogenation is a type of substitution reaction where a halogen atom (like chlorine or bromine) replaces a hydrogen atom in an alkane. This reaction requires ultraviolet light (UV) or heat.

- **Example Reaction**:
  $$ \text{CH}_4 + \text{Cl}_2 \xrightarrow{hv} \text{CH}_3\text{Cl} + \text{HCl} $$

In this reaction, **methane** (CH₄) reacts with chlorine (Cl₂) under UV light to form **chloromethane** (CH₃Cl) and **hydrogen chloride** (HCl).

### 1.2 Nitration
Nitration of alkanes occurs in the presence of a nitrating mixture (a combination of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid). This reaction is less common for alkanes but can occur under special conditions.

- **Example Reaction**:
  $$ \text{C}_2\text{H}_6 + \text{HNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{NO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} $$

In this reaction, **ethane** (C₂H₆) reacts with nitric acid (HNO₃) to form **ethanone** (C₂H₅NO₂) and water (H₂O).

### 1.3 Sulphonation
Sulphonation of alkanes is a reaction with sulfur trioxide (SO₃) to form alkyl sulfonic acids. This reaction is also less common for alkanes but can occur under certain conditions.

- **Example Reaction**:
  $$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{SO}_3 \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{SO}_3 $$

This reaction shows the sulphonation of **benzene** (C₆H₆) forming **benzene sulfonic acid** (C₆H₅SO₃), though alkanes typically do not undergo this reaction easily.

## 2. Oxidation of Ethane

Oxidation of ethane involves the addition of oxygen, leading to the formation of oxidation products such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids depending on the reaction conditions.

- **Partial Oxidation (To Ethanol)**:
  $$ \text{C}_2\text{H}_6 + \text{O}_2 \xrightarrow{(O_2, \text{moderate temp.})} \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH} $$

This reaction shows the oxidation of **ethane** (C₂H₆) with oxygen (O₂) to form **ethanol** (C₂H₅OH).

- **Complete Oxidation (To Carbon Dioxide)**:
  $$ \text{C}_2\text{H}_6 + 5\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 4\text{CO}_2 + 6\text{H}_2\text{O} $$

In complete oxidation, ethane is completely converted into **carbon dioxide** (CO₂) and **water** (H₂O).

## Summary

Substitution reactions like halogenation, nitration, and sulphonation modify alkanes by replacing hydrogen atoms with halogens, nitro groups, or sulfonic acid groups. Additionally, the oxidation of ethane can produce a range of products depending on the reaction conditions, including ethanol or carbon dioxide.

## FAQs

### 1. What is halogenation in alkanes?
Halogenation is the substitution of hydrogen atoms in alkanes with halogen atoms, typically in the presence of UV light.

### 2. How does nitration occur in alkanes?
Nitration of alkanes involves the reaction with nitric acid to form nitroalkanes.

### 3. What does sulphonation of alkanes produce?
Sulphonation of alkanes involves the reaction with sulfur trioxide, producing alkyl sulfonic acids.

### 4. What is the result of the oxidation of ethane?
Oxidation of ethane can produce ethanol or, under complete oxidation, carbon dioxide and water.

### 5. What is the difference between partial and complete oxidation of ethane?
Partial oxidation of ethane forms ethanol, while complete oxidation forms carbon dioxide and water.

### 6. How is halogenation of alkanes initiated?
Halogenation of alkanes is usually initiated by UV light or heat.

### 7. What role does UV light play in halogenation?
UV light provides the energy needed to break the halogen molecule into free radicals, which then react with the alkane.

### 8. Can alkanes undergo nitration easily?
No, alkanes do not typically undergo nitration easily and require special conditions, such as the use of a nitrating mixture.

### 9. What is produced during the oxidation of ethane under mild conditions?
Under mild conditions, the oxidation of ethane produces ethanol.

### 10. What products are formed when ethane undergoes complete oxidation?
When ethane undergoes complete oxidation, the products are carbon dioxide and water.

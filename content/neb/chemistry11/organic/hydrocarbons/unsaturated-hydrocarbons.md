# Unsaturated Hydrocarbons: Alkenes and Alkynes

Unsaturated hydrocarbons are organic compounds that contain one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms. Alkenes and alkynes are two important categories of unsaturated hydrocarbons, each having unique properties and chemical behavior.

---

## 1. Alkenes (CₙH₂ₙ)

Alkenes are hydrocarbons that contain at least one **carbon-carbon double bond** (C=C). The general formula for alkenes is **CₙH₂ₙ**, where "n" represents the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.

### 1.1 Structure and Bonding
- **Double Bond**: The presence of a double bond means that two pairs of electrons are shared between two carbon atoms. This results in a **planar structure** around the double bond, and the geometry around each carbon atom in the double bond is **sp² hybridized**.
- **Example**: **Ethene (C₂H₄)** has the structure:
  $$
  \text{H}_2\text{C} = \text{CH}_2
  $$

### 1.2 Reactions of Alkenes

Alkenes undergo various chemical reactions due to the presence of the electron-rich double bond. Some common reactions include:

- **Addition Reactions**: In these reactions, the double bond is broken, and atoms or groups are added to the carbon atoms.
  - **Hydrogenation**: Addition of hydrogen to form alkanes.
    $$ \text{C}_2\text{H}_4 + \text{H}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Ni}} \text{C}_2\text{H}_6 $$
  - **Halogenation**: Addition of halogens like chlorine or bromine.
    $$ \text{C}_2\text{H}_4 + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_4\text{Cl}_2 $$

- **Polymerization**: Many alkenes can undergo polymerization to form long-chain polymers.
  - **Example**: Ethene polymerizes to form polyethylene:
    $$ \text{nC}_2\text{H}_4 \rightarrow \text{(-C}_2\text{H}_4\text{)}_n $$

## 2. Alkynes (CₙH₂ₙ₋₂)

Alkynes are hydrocarbons that contain at least one **carbon-carbon triple bond** (C≡C). The general formula for alkynes is **CₙH₂ₙ₋₂**, where "n" is the number of carbon atoms.

### 2.1 Structure and Bonding
- **Triple Bond**: The triple bond consists of one sigma bond and two pi bonds. This results in **linear geometry** around the triple bond, with **sp hybridization** of the carbon atoms.
- **Example**: **Ethyne (C₂H₂)** has the structure:
  $$
  \text{HC} \equiv \text{CH}
  $$

### 2.2 Reactions of Alkynes

Alkynes undergo a variety of reactions due to the electron-rich triple bond. Common reactions include:

- **Addition Reactions**: Like alkenes, alkynes undergo addition reactions, where the triple bond is broken.
  - **Hydrogenation**: Addition of hydrogen to form alkenes or alkanes.
    $$ \text{C}_2\text{H}_2 + \text{H}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Ni}} \text{C}_2\text{H}_4 $$

  - **Halogenation**: Addition of halogens to form dihaloalkenes.
    $$ \text{C}_2\text{H}_2 + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_2\text{Br}_2 $$

- **Hydrohalogenation**: Addition of a hydrogen halide (e.g., HCl) to form haloalkenes.
  - **Example**: 
    $$ \text{C}_2\text{H}_2 + \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_3\text{Cl} $$

## Summary

Alkenes and alkynes are important unsaturated hydrocarbons with distinct structural characteristics. Alkenes contain a carbon-carbon double bond, while alkynes contain a carbon-carbon triple bond. Both types of hydrocarbons undergo similar reactions, such as addition reactions, but they differ in the number of bonds and the types of products formed. Alkenes and alkynes are essential in the synthesis of a wide range of organic compounds and materials.

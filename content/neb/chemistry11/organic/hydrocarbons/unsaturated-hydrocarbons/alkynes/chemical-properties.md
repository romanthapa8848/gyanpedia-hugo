# Alkynes: Chemical Properties

Alkynes, characterized by carbon-carbon triple bonds, exhibit specific chemical properties such as **addition reactions** and **acidic behavior**. This section discusses the mechanisms and outcomes of these reactions.

---

## 1. Addition Reactions

### (i) Addition of Hydrogen (Hydrogenation)
In hydrogenation, alkynes add hydrogen atoms across the triple bond, converting them into either **alkenes** or **alkanes**.

- **Partial Hydrogenation**:
  $$ \text{RC} \equiv \text{CR} + \text{H}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Pd/BaSO}_4, \text{quinoline}} \text{RCH=CHR} $$

  Partial hydrogenation yields **cis-alkenes** in the presence of a poisoned catalyst such as **Pd/BaSO₄**.

- **Complete Hydrogenation**:
  $$ \text{RC} \equiv \text{CR} + 2\text{H}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Ni}} \text{RCH₂CH₂R} $$

  Full hydrogenation results in the formation of alkanes with nickel (Ni) as the catalyst.

### (ii) Addition of Hydrogen Halides (HX)

In the presence of **hydrogen halides (HX)**, alkynes undergo electrophilic addition, with Markovnikov’s rule governing the orientation of the addition.

- **Markovnikov Addition**:
  $$ \text{RC} \equiv \text{CH} + \text{HX} \rightarrow \text{RCH=CHX} $$

  When excess HX is added, a second molecule attaches, producing a geminal dihalide:
  $$ \text{RCH=CHX + HX} \rightarrow \text{RCHXCHX} $$

### (iii) Addition of Water (Hydration)

Hydration of alkynes occurs under acidic conditions with mercuric sulfate (HgSO₄) as a catalyst, forming **enols** that tautomerize to form ketones.

- **Example Reaction**:
  $$ \text{RC} \equiv \text{CH} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{\text{HgSO}_4, \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4} \text{RCOCH}_3 $$

## 2. Acidic Nature of Alkynes

Alkynes with a terminal hydrogen exhibit acidic behavior, allowing them to react with metals and certain metallic compounds.

### (i) Reaction with Sodium

Terminal alkynes react with **sodium** to produce **alkynyl sodium salts** and hydrogen gas.

- **Example Reaction**:
  $$ \text{RC} \equiv \text{CH} + 2\text{Na} \rightarrow \text{RC} \equiv \text{CNa} + \text{H}_2 $$

### (ii) Reaction with Ammoniacal Silver Nitrate (AgNO₃)

Terminal alkynes react with **ammoniacal silver nitrate (AgNO₃)**, forming a **white precipitate** of silver alkynide.

- **Example Reaction**:
  $$ \text{RC} \equiv \text{CH} + \text{AgNO}_3 (\text{NH}_3) \rightarrow \text{RC} \equiv \text{CAg} + \text{HNO}_3 $$

### (iii) Reaction with Ammoniacal Cuprous Chloride (Cu₂Cl₂)

Alkynes react with **ammoniacal cuprous chloride (Cu₂Cl₂)**, resulting in the formation of a **red precipitate** of copper(I) alkynide.

- **Example Reaction**:
  $$ \text{RC} \equiv \text{CH} + \text{Cu}_2\text{Cl}_2 (\text{NH}_3) \rightarrow \text{RC} \equiv \text{CCu} + \text{HCl} $$

## Summary

Alkynes undergo addition reactions due to the presence of a triple bond, while their acidic nature allows them to react with metals, forming compounds like silver and copper alkynides. These reactions have significant applications in synthetic organic chemistry.

## FAQs

### 1. What type of bond do alkynes have?
Alkynes have a **carbon-carbon triple bond**.

### 2. What is hydrogenation of an alkyne?
Hydrogenation is the addition of hydrogen across the triple bond of an alkyne, forming an alkane.

### 3. What catalyst is used for partial hydrogenation of alkynes?
**Pd/BaSO₄** with quinoline is used for partial hydrogenation, producing **cis-alkenes**.

### 4. How do alkynes react with hydrogen halides?
Alkynes react with **HX** to form vinyl halides, and with excess HX, they form geminal dihalides.

### 5. What is Markovnikov’s rule?
Markovnikov's rule states that in an electrophilic addition to an unsymmetrical alkyne, the halogen attaches to the more substituted carbon.

### 6. Why are terminal alkynes acidic?
Terminal alkynes are acidic due to the presence of a hydrogen atom on the terminal carbon, which can be released as a proton.

### 7. What is the product of alkyne reaction with AgNO₃?
Alkynes produce **silver alkynide** with ammoniacal AgNO₃, appearing as a white precipitate.

### 8. How do terminal alkynes react with sodium?

### 9. What is the product of hydration of ethyne?
Hydration of ethyne forms **acetaldehyde**.

### 10. What is the use of ammoniacal Cu₂Cl₂ in alkyne reactions?
Ammoniacal Cu₂Cl₂ forms **copper(I) alkynide** as a red precipitate with terminal alkynes.

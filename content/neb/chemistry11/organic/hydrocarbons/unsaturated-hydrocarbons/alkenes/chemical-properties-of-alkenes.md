# Addition Reactions of Alkenes

Alkenes undergo various addition reactions where atoms or groups add to the carbon atoms of the double bond. Some key reactions include the addition of **HX**, **water**, **ozone**, and **sulfuric acid**. Below are the details of each of these reactions, along with the effects of Markovnikov's rule and the peroxide effect.

## 1. Addition of HX to Alkenes (Markovnikov’s Rule)

When an alkene reacts with a hydrogen halide (**HX**), the addition occurs following **Markovnikov’s rule**, which states that the hydrogen atom from HX will add to the carbon of the double bond that already has the most hydrogen atoms, and the halide (X) will add to the other carbon. 

- **Example Reaction**:
  - $\text{CH}_2=\text{CH}_2 + \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{Cl}$
  - In this reaction, **ethene ($C_2H_4$)** reacts with **hydrogen chloride (HCl)** to form **ethyl chloride ($C_2H_5Cl$)**, following Markovnikov's rule.

### Peroxide Effect (Anti-Markovnikov’s Addition)

In the presence of peroxides, the addition of HX to an alkene follows the **anti-Markovnikov** rule. This means the halide (X) adds to the carbon with the most hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen (H) adds to the other carbon. This effect is due to the formation of free radicals during the reaction.

- **Example Reaction**:
  - $\text{CH}_2=\text{CH}_2 + \text{HBr} \xrightarrow{\text{peroxide}} \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{Br}$
  - In this case, **ethene** reacts with **hydrobromic acid (HBr)** in the presence of **peroxide** to form **ethyl bromide** in an anti-Markovnikov manner.

## 2. Hydration (Addition of Water)

The addition of water to an alkene is known as **hydration**. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst, such as **sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)**, to proceed. The reaction adds a hydroxyl group (**OH**) to one carbon of the double bond and a hydrogen atom (**H**) to the other carbon, following Markovnikov's rule.

- **Example Reaction**:
  - $\text{CH}_2=\text{CH}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{H_2SO_4} \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH}$
  - In this reaction, **ethene** reacts with **water (H₂O)** in the presence of **sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)** to form **ethanol ($C_2H_5OH$)**.

## 3. Ozonolysis of Alkenes (Addition of O₃)

**Ozonolysis** is a reaction where an alkene reacts with **ozone (O₃)** to form **ozonides**, which can then be cleaved to produce carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones). This reaction is often used to break carbon-carbon double bonds in alkenes.

- **Example Reaction**:
  - $\text{CH}_2=\text{CH}_2 + \text{O}_3 \rightarrow \text{CH}_2\text{O} + \text{CH}_2\text{O}$
  - In this example, **ethene** reacts with **ozone** to form **formaldehyde** after the cleavage of the ozonide.

## 4. Addition of Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄)

Alkenes can also react with **sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)** to form **alkyl hydrogen sulfates**, which can be further hydrolyzed to form alcohols.

- **Example Reaction**:
  - $\text{CH}_2=\text{CH}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OSO₃H}$
  - In this reaction, **ethene** reacts with **sulfuric acid** to form **ethyl hydrogen sulfate** ($C_2H_5HSO_4$), which can then be hydrolyzed to form **ethanol**.

---

## Summary

Addition reactions are important reactions of alkenes, and they follow specific rules, such as **Markovnikov’s rule** and **anti-Markovnikov’s rule (peroxide effect)**. These reactions include the addition of **HX**, **water**, **ozone**, and **sulfuric acid**, each of which results in the formation of different products depending on the reagents and conditions.

## FAQs

### 1. What is Markovnikov's rule in addition reactions?
Markovnikov's rule states that in the addition of HX to an alkene, the hydrogen atom adds to the carbon with the most hydrogen atoms, and the halide adds to the other carbon.

### 2. What is the peroxide effect in alkene addition reactions?
The peroxide effect is when the addition of HX to an alkene in the presence of peroxides follows the anti-Markovnikov rule, where the halide adds to the carbon with more hydrogen atoms.

### 3. How does hydration of alkenes occur?
Hydration of alkenes involves the addition of water across the double bond in the presence of an acid catalyst, following Markovnikov’s rule.

### 4. What happens during ozonolysis of alkenes?
Ozonolysis involves the addition of ozone to an alkene, forming an ozonide, which is then cleaved to form carbonyl compounds like aldehydes or ketones.

### 5. How does sulfuric acid react with alkenes?
Sulfuric acid reacts with alkenes to form alkyl hydrogen sulfates, which can be hydrolyzed to form alcohols.

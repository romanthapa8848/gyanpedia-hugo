# Definition and Classification of Isomerism

## Definition of Isomerism

**Isomerism** is a phenomenon where compounds have the same molecular formula but differ in structure, spatial arrangement, or connectivity of atoms. These differences result in distinct compounds with unique physical or chemical properties despite having the same number and type of atoms.

## Classification of Isomerism

Isomerism can be broadly categorized into **structural isomerism** and **stereoisomerism**.

### 1. Structural Isomerism

In structural isomerism, compounds differ in the connectivity of atoms or the structure of the molecule. Types of structural isomers include:

- **Chain Isomerism**: Molecules differ in the branching of the carbon chain. Example: butane and isobutane.
  
- **Position Isomerism**: Functional groups or substituents are located at different positions on the carbon chain. Example: 1-propanol and 2-propanol.
  
- **Functional Isomerism**: Compounds have the same molecular formula but different functional groups. Example: C₂H₆O, which can be ethanol (an alcohol) or dimethyl ether (an ether).
  
- **Metamerism**: Isomers differ due to the length of alkyl chains on either side of a functional group (e.g., ethers).
  
- **Tautomerism**: This is a dynamic form of isomerism where molecules interconvert between forms, such as keto-enol tautomers in organic chemistry.

### 2. Stereoisomerism

Stereoisomers have the same connectivity of atoms but differ in the spatial arrangement. Types of stereoisomerism include:

- **Geometric Isomerism (Cis-Trans)**: Isomers are distinguished by the arrangement of substituents around a double bond or a ring structure with restricted rotation. Cis isomers have substituents on the same side, while trans isomers have them on opposite sides.
  
- **Optical Isomerism**: Compounds that have chiral centers and can rotate plane-polarized light differently. These include:
  - **Enantiomers**: Non-superimposable mirror images of each other.
  - **Diastereomers**: Isomers that are not mirror images of each other.

## Summary

Isomerism provides insight into the structural diversity of organic compounds, allowing for molecules with identical molecular formulas to exhibit unique properties due to different structures or spatial arrangements.

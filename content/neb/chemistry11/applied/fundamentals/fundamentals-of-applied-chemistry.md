## Chemical Reactions in Applied Chemistry

Chemical reactions are the foundation of applied chemistry. In industry, chemical reactions are used to synthesize compounds, produce materials, and generate energy. Some common chemical reactions include:

- **Combustion**: The reaction of a substance with oxygen to produce heat and light. Example: The combustion of fuels like natural gas ($\text{CH}_4$) and gasoline ($\text{C}_8\text{H}_{18}$).
  
  $$ \text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} $$

- **Redox Reactions**: Reactions involving the transfer of electrons, essential in batteries and energy storage.

- **Acid-Base Reactions**: Important in the formation of salts and in processes like titration and neutralization.

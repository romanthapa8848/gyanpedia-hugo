# Manufacture of Sodium Hydroxide by Diaphragm Cell

The **manufacture of sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**, commonly known as **caustic soda**, is primarily done through the **chlor-alkali process**. This process involves the electrolysis of sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, also known as brine, to produce sodium hydroxide, chlorine gas (Cl₂), and hydrogen gas (H₂). The **diaphragm cell** is one of the methods used in this process to separate the products and prevent unwanted reactions between them.

## 1. Chemical Reactions

The overall reaction during the electrolysis of brine is:
$$
2NaCl (aq) + 2H₂O (l) \xrightarrow{electricity} 2NaOH (aq) + Cl₂ (g) + H₂ (g)
$$

This reaction shows that for every 2 moles of sodium chloride, 2 moles of sodium hydroxide, 1 mole of chlorine gas, and 1 mole of hydrogen gas are produced.

In the **diaphragm cell**, the electrolysis process occurs in the following manner:

### Anode Reaction (Chlorine Gas Formation)
At the anode (positive electrode), chloride ions are oxidized to chlorine gas:
$$
2Cl⁻ (aq) \xrightarrow{anode} Cl₂ (g) + 2e⁻
$$

### Cathode Reaction (Hydrogen Gas Formation)
At the cathode (negative electrode), water is reduced to hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions:
$$
2H₂O (l) + 2e⁻ \xrightarrow{cathode} H₂ (g) + 2OH⁻ (aq)
$$

## 2. Diaphragm Cell Structure

The **diaphragm cell** consists of three main sections:
1. **Anode Compartment**: Contains the anode, where chlorine gas is produced.
2. **Cathode Compartment**: Contains the cathode, where hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide are produced.
3. **Diaphragm**: A porous diaphragm (typically made from asbestos or synthetic materials) separates the anode and cathode compartments to prevent the chlorine gas and sodium hydroxide from mixing. This diaphragm allows the movement of sodium ions but prevents the mixing of the products.

## 3. Electrolysis Process

1. **Preparation of Brine**: A saturated solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) is prepared, commonly referred to as **brine**.
   
2. **Electrolysis**: The brine is subjected to **electrolysis** in the diaphragm cell. When electric current is passed through the solution:
   - Chlorine gas (Cl₂) is produced at the anode.
   - Hydrogen gas (H₂) is produced at the cathode.
   - Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is produced in the solution around the cathode.

3. **Separation of Products**: The diaphragm ensures that the chlorine gas produced at the anode does not come in contact with the sodium hydroxide produced at the cathode, preventing the formation of unwanted sodium chloride.

## 4. Advantages of Diaphragm Cell

- **Separation of Products**: The diaphragm prevents the mixing of chlorine and sodium hydroxide, allowing for the separate collection of each product.
- **Lower Cost**: Diaphragm cells are simpler and more cost-effective compared to mercury cells or membrane cells.
- **Safer Operation**: The diaphragm helps minimize the risk of hazardous reactions between chlorine and sodium hydroxide.

---

## 5. Disadvantages of Diaphragm Cell

- **Lower Efficiency**: Diaphragm cells produce a diluted solution of sodium hydroxide, which requires further concentration.
- **Environmental Impact**: The use of asbestos diaphragms poses health risks, and efforts are being made to replace them with safer materials.
- **Limited Purity**: The sodium hydroxide produced may contain impurities, making it less pure than that produced by membrane cells.

## 6. Uses of Sodium Hydroxide

Sodium hydroxide is widely used in various industries, including:
- **Soap and detergent production**: NaOH is used in saponification to make soap.
- **Paper and pulp industry**: It is used in the process of pulping wood and bleaching paper.
- **Chemical manufacturing**: NaOH is used in the production of various chemicals like sodium salts, plastics, and synthetic fibers.
- **Water treatment**: It is used to neutralize acids and to adjust the pH of water.

## Summary

The **diaphragm cell** is a method used in the chlor-alkali process to manufacture sodium hydroxide (caustic soda). The electrolysis of sodium chloride (brine) produces sodium hydroxide, chlorine gas, and hydrogen gas. The diaphragm separates the anode and cathode compartments, ensuring the products do not mix. This method is widely used due to its relatively lower cost and simpler design, though it may produce a less concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide compared to other methods.

# Manufacture of Sulfuric Acid by Contact Process

The **Contact Process** is the most widely used method for the industrial production of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), which is a vital chemical used in the production of fertilizers, detergents, batteries, and in petroleum refining. The process involves the oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) to sulfur trioxide (SO₃), which is then dissolved in water to produce sulfuric acid.

## 1. Chemical Reactions

The Contact Process consists of the following key reactions:

1. **Oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide:**
$$
2SO₂ (g) + O₂ (g) \xrightarrow{450°C, 2 atm, \, V₂O₅} 2SO₃ (g)
$$

2. **Conversion of sulfur trioxide to oleum:**
$$
SO₃ (g) + H₂O (l) \xrightarrow{} H₂SO₄ (aq)
$$

The sulfur trioxide reacts with water to form sulfuric acid. However, directly dissolving SO₃ in water is highly exothermic and not preferred. Instead, SO₃ is first absorbed in concentrated sulfuric acid to form oleum (H₂S₂O₇).

## 2. Stages of the Contact Process

### a) **Preparation of Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)**

- Sulfur dioxide is usually prepared by burning sulfur in oxygen (air) at high temperatures:
$$
S (s) + O₂ (g) \xrightarrow{} SO₂ (g)
$$

Alternatively, sulfur dioxide can be obtained from the combustion of sulfur-containing ores like pyrite (FeS₂).

### b) **Oxidation of Sulfur Dioxide to Sulfur Trioxide**

- The sulfur dioxide is then passed through a **contact reactor** containing a **vanadium oxide (V₂O₅)** catalyst at a temperature of around **450°C** and a pressure of approximately **2 atm**. The reaction is an equilibrium process:
$$
2SO₂ (g) + O₂ (g) \xrightarrow{450°C, 2 atm, \, V₂O₅} 2SO₃ (g)
$$
- The catalyst is used to speed up the reaction without being consumed, allowing the reaction to proceed faster at lower temperatures.

### c) **Conversion of Sulfur Trioxide to Oleum**

- The sulfur trioxide (SO₃) formed is then absorbed into concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) to form **oleum** (H₂S₂O₇), an intermediate product:
$$
SO₃ (g) + H₂SO₄ (l) \xrightarrow{} H₂S₂O₇ (l)
$$
- Oleum is a mixture of sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid.

### d) **Conversion of Oleum to Sulfuric Acid**

- Finally, the oleum is diluted with water to produce concentrated sulfuric acid:
$$
H₂S₂O₇ (l) + H₂O (l) \xrightarrow{} 2H₂SO₄ (aq)
$$

## 3. Conditions for the Contact Process

- **Temperature**: The reaction takes place at around **450°C** for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide.
- **Pressure**: The process is carried out at a pressure of about **2 atm**.
- **Catalyst**: **Vanadium pentoxide (V₂O₅)** is used as a catalyst to speed up the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide.

These conditions are optimized to maximize the yield of sulfur trioxide while keeping the process efficient and cost-effective.

## 4. Importance of Sulfuric Acid

Sulfuric acid is one of the most widely produced and used chemicals in the world. Its main uses include:
- **Fertilizer production**: It is used in the production of phosphate fertilizers (e.g., ammonium phosphate).
- **Petroleum refining**: Sulfuric acid is used to remove impurities from crude oil.
- **Manufacture of detergents**: It is used in the production of synthetic detergents.
- **Battery acid**: Sulfuric acid is used in lead-acid batteries.
- **Chemical synthesis**: It is used as a catalyst or reactant in the production of other chemicals like detergents, dyes, and explosives.

## 5. Efficiency and Yield

The Contact Process is efficient because the sulfur dioxide oxidation reaction is driven to completion using a catalyst and optimal temperature and pressure conditions. However, the reaction is reversible, so care must be taken to remove the products and maintain high conversion efficiency.

---

## Summary

The Contact Process is a key industrial method for producing sulfuric acid, which is crucial for various chemical industries. By converting sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide and then dissolving it in water (in the form of oleum), this process efficiently produces concentrated sulfuric acid. The Contact Process is vital for producing fertilizers, detergents, and other chemicals.

## FAQs

### 1. What is sulfuric acid used for?
Sulfuric acid is used in fertilizer production, petroleum refining, manufacturing detergents, and as a catalyst in chemical synthesis.

### 2. What is the catalyst used in the Contact Process?
The catalyst used in the Contact Process is **vanadium pentoxide (V₂O₅)**.

### 3. What is oleum?
Oleum is a mixture of sulfur trioxide (SO₃) dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).

### 4. Why is sulfur trioxide absorbed in concentrated sulfuric acid instead of directly in water?
Direct absorption of sulfur trioxide in water is highly exothermic and can cause splattering. Therefore, it is first absorbed in concentrated sulfuric acid to form oleum.

### 5. What is the temperature used in the Contact Process?
The temperature for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide is around **450°C**.

### 6. How is sulfur dioxide prepared for the Contact Process?
Sulfur dioxide can be prepared by burning sulfur in air or by roasting sulfur-containing ores like pyrite (FeS₂).

### 7. What are the main products of the Contact Process?
The main products are sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and oleum.

### 8. What are the uses of sulfuric acid in the chemical industry?
Sulfuric acid is used in the production of fertilizers, detergents, petroleum refining, and chemical synthesis.

### 9. Why is vanadium pentoxide used as a catalyst in the Contact Process?
Vanadium pentoxide is used because it effectively speeds up the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide at moderate temperatures and pressures.

### 10. What is the final product of the Contact Process?
The final product of the Contact Process is **sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)**.

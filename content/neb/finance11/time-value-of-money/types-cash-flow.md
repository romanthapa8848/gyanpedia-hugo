Cash flow refers to the movement of money into and out of a business or individual’s account over a specific period. The classification of cash flow is done based on the source or purpose of the cash movement. There are three primary types of cash flow:

1. **Operating Cash Flow (OCF)**
2. **Investing Cash Flow (ICF)**
3. **Financing Cash Flow (FCF)**

Each type of cash flow represents different activities within a company and helps provide a clear understanding of a company's liquidity and financial health.

# Present Value of Perpetuities

A **perpetuity** is a type of annuity that continues forever, meaning the payments go on indefinitely without end. In finance, the **present value of perpetuity** refers to the current worth of an infinite series of cash flows, which are expected to occur at regular intervals. The concept is useful when valuing assets that generate constant cash flows over an indefinite period, such as preferred stocks or certain real estate investments.

## Formula for Present Value of Perpetuity

The formula to calculate the **present value of perpetuity** is:

$$
PV = \frac{C}{r}
$$

Where:

- $PV$ = Present value of the perpetuity
- $C$ = Cash flow (payment) received each period
- $r$ = Discount rate or interest rate per period

This formula assumes that the perpetuity starts immediately and the cash flows are received at the end of each period.

### Example:

Let’s assume the following values:

- The annual payment ($C$) is $1,000
- The interest rate ($r$) is 5% or 0.05

To find the present value of the perpetuity ($PV$):

$$
PV = \frac{1000}{0.05} = 20,000
$$

Thus, the present value of the perpetuity is $20,000.

## Key Characteristics of Perpetuities

- **Constant Cash Flows:** Perpetuities assume the same amount of cash flow ($C$) is received indefinitely.
- **No End Date:** Unlike regular annuities, perpetuities have no maturity date. The payments continue forever.
- **Fixed Interest Rate:** The rate of return ($r$) is assumed to be constant for the entire duration of the perpetuity.

## Types of Perpetuities

1. **Fixed Perpetuity:** This type of perpetuity pays a fixed cash flow ($C$) indefinitely, regardless of changes in economic conditions or inflation.
2. **Growing Perpetuity:** In a growing perpetuity, the cash flows ($C$) increase at a constant rate ($g$) each period. The formula for the present value of a growing perpetuity is:

$$
PV = \frac{C}{r - g}
$$

Where $g$ is the growth rate of the cash flow.

## Example of Growing Perpetuity:

Suppose a company pays a dividend of $500 annually, and the dividend grows at a rate of 3% each year. The required rate of return is 8%. The present value of the growing perpetuity is calculated as:

$$
PV = \frac{500}{0.08 - 0.03} = \frac{500}{0.05} = 10,000
$$

Thus, the present value of the growing perpetuity is $10,000.

## Summary

- **Present Value of Perpetuity Formula:** $PV = \frac{C}{r}$
- Perpetuities represent infinite series of cash flows that go on forever.
- They are used in financial models to calculate the value of assets that generate constant cash flows over an indefinite period.

## FAQs

### 1. What is a perpetuity?

A perpetuity is a series of cash flows that continue forever, with a fixed amount received at regular intervals.

### 2. How is the present value of a perpetuity calculated?

The present value of a perpetuity is calculated using the formula $PV = \frac{C}{r}$, where $C$ is the cash flow per period, and $r$ is the discount rate.

### 3. What is the formula for the present value of a growing perpetuity?

The formula for the present value of a growing perpetuity is $PV = \frac{C}{r - g}$, where $C$ is the cash flow, $r$ is the discount rate, and $g$ is the growth rate of the cash flow.

### 4. Can a perpetuity have a finite duration?

No, a perpetuity is defined as having an infinite duration. However, if the cash flows stop at a certain point, it would no longer be a perpetuity.

### 5. What is the difference between a perpetuity and an annuity?

A perpetuity pays an infinite series of cash flows, whereas an annuity pays a fixed number of cash flows for a specific period.

### 6. How does the discount rate affect the present value of a perpetuity?

The higher the discount rate ($r$), the lower the present value of the perpetuity, as the future cash flows are worth less today.

### 7. What happens if the cash flow ($C$) changes over time?

If the cash flow ($C$) changes over time, it would no longer be considered a perpetuity. Instead, it may be classified as an annuity or a growing perpetuity if the changes follow a regular pattern.

### 8. Can perpetuities be used in corporate finance?

Yes, perpetuities are often used to value preferred stock or certain bonds that provide a consistent stream of payments indefinitely.

### 9. How is the present value of a growing perpetuity different from a fixed perpetuity?

A growing perpetuity has cash flows that increase at a constant rate, while a fixed perpetuity has constant cash flows.

### 10. Why is the present value of a perpetuity important?

The present value of a perpetuity is important for determining the worth of assets or investments that generate an ongoing stream of income over time.

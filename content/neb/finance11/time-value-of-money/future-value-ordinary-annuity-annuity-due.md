# Future Value of Ordinary Annuity and Annuity Due

An annuity is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals. The **future value** of an annuity refers to the amount accumulated at the end of the specified period, considering the interest or return on the investment.

## 1. Future Value of Ordinary Annuity (FVOA)

In an **ordinary annuity**, payments are made at the **end** of each period. The formula to calculate the future value of an ordinary annuity is:

$$
FV_{OA} = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
$$

Where:

- $FV_{OA}$ = Future value of the ordinary annuity
- $P$ = Payment amount per period
- $r$ = Interest rate per period
- $n$ = Number of periods

## 2. Future Value of Annuity Due (FVAD)

In an **annuity due**, payments are made at the **beginning** of each period. The formula to calculate the future value of an annuity due is:

$$
FV_{AD} = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \times (1 + r)
$$

Where:

- $FV_{AD}$ = Future value of the annuity due
- $P$ = Payment amount per period
- $r$ = Interest rate per period
- $n$ = Number of periods

The key difference between the two is that for an annuity due, each payment is invested for one extra period compared to an ordinary annuity.

## Example:

Let's assume:

- Payment ($P$) = $1,000
- Interest rate ($r$) = 5% per period (or 0.05)
- Number of periods ($n$) = 10 years

### Future Value of Ordinary Annuity (FVOA):

$$
FV_{OA} = 1000 \times \frac{(1 + 0.05)^{10} - 1}{0.05}
$$

$$
FV_{OA} = 1000 \times \frac{(1.62889) - 1}{0.05}
$$

$$
FV_{OA} = 1000 \times \frac{0.62889}{0.05} = 1000 \times 12.5778 = 12,577.8
$$

### Future Value of Annuity Due (FVAD):

$$
FV_{AD} = 1000 \times \frac{(1 + 0.05)^{10} - 1}{0.05} \times (1 + 0.05)
$$

$$
FV_{AD} = 1000 \times \frac{(1.62889) - 1}{0.05} \times 1.05
$$

$$
FV_{AD} = 1000 \times \frac{0.62889}{0.05} \times 1.05 = 1000 \times 12.5778 \times 1.05 = 13,209.6
$$

## Summary

- The **Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity (FVOA)** is calculated using the formula $FV_{OA} = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}$ and assumes payments are made at the end of each period.
- The **Future Value of an Annuity Due (FVAD)** is calculated using the formula $FV_{AD} = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \times (1 + r)$ and assumes payments are made at the beginning of each period, making the future value higher than the ordinary annuity.

## FAQs

### 1. What is an ordinary annuity?

An ordinary annuity is a series of equal payments made at the end of each period.

### 2. How does the future value of an annuity due differ from an ordinary annuity?

In an annuity due, payments are made at the beginning of each period, allowing for higher future value compared to an ordinary annuity, where payments are made at the end of each period.

### 3. How do I calculate the future value of an annuity due?

The formula for the future value of an annuity due is $FV_{AD} = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \times (1 + r)$.

### 4. What is the difference between an ordinary annuity and an annuity due in terms of payment timing?

In an ordinary annuity, payments are made at the end of each period, while in an annuity due, payments are made at the beginning of each period.

### 5. What factors affect the future value of an annuity?

The future value of an annuity is affected by the amount of the periodic payment ($P$), the interest rate ($r$), and the number of periods ($n$).

### 6. Can I calculate the future value of an annuity if the interest rate is zero?

Yes, if the interest rate is zero, the future value of both ordinary annuity and annuity due would simply be the sum of the periodic payments.

### 7. What is the impact of increasing the number of periods on the future value of an annuity?

Increasing the number of periods will increase the future value of the annuity because the interest has more time to accumulate.

### 8. How does the interest rate impact the future value of an annuity?

A higher interest rate results in a higher future value of the annuity, as the amount earned on each payment grows faster.

### 9. Is the future value of an annuity due always higher than that of an ordinary annuity?

Yes, the future value of an annuity due is always higher than that of an ordinary annuity because each payment in an annuity due earns interest for one additional period.

### 10. Can the future value of an annuity be negative?

The future value of an annuity is generally positive, as it represents the accumulated amount of periodic payments. However, if the payments or interest rates are negative, the future value can be negative.

# Functions of Banks

Banks are crucial financial institutions in any economy, as they facilitate the movement of money and credit, offer financial services, and support economic development. They perform various functions that contribute to the smooth functioning of the financial system.

## Primary Functions of Banks

The primary functions of banks can be broadly classified into the following categories:

### 1. **Accepting Deposits**

One of the most basic functions of a bank is to accept deposits from individuals, businesses, and other entities. Banks provide a safe place for depositors to keep their money, offering different types of accounts, including:

- **Savings Accounts**: Accounts where individuals deposit money and earn interest.
- **Current Accounts**: Accounts used by businesses or individuals for daily transactions, which usually do not earn interest.
- **Fixed Deposits**: Accounts where a fixed amount is deposited for a specific period at a fixed rate of interest.

By accepting deposits, banks not only provide a safe space for savings but also mobilize these funds for lending purposes.

### 2. **Providing Loans and Advances**

Banks provide loans and advances to individuals, businesses, and the government. These loans are used for a variety of purposes, such as personal expenses, business expansion, and infrastructure projects. Banks charge interest on the loans they provide, which is a primary source of revenue for them.

- **Personal Loans**: Loans for individual needs like buying a car, home, or education.
- **Business Loans**: Loans extended to businesses for growth and operational needs.
- **Housing Loans**: Long-term loans specifically for buying homes or property.

Banks also offer short-term loans (working capital loans) to businesses to manage their day-to-day operations.

### 3. **Facilitating Payment Services**

Banks are instrumental in facilitating payments and making transactions easier and safer for both individuals and businesses. They offer various services such as:

- **Cheque Clearing**: A method of transferring money between banks using a cheque as a medium.
- **Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)**: A system that transfers money from one account to another through electronic means.
- **Online Banking**: Services that allow customers to perform financial transactions using a computer or mobile device.
- **Mobile Banking**: The ability to perform banking transactions through mobile devices.

Banks play a critical role in ensuring that payments can be made efficiently, both within the country and internationally.

### 4. **Credit Creation**

One of the essential functions of banks is **credit creation**. When banks lend money to borrowers, they do not lend out the exact amount of their deposits. Instead, they lend a multiple of their deposits, which results in the creation of new money in the economy. This process is known as **credit creation** and is an important tool in economic expansion.

For example, when a bank lends out $1,000, the borrower might deposit that money into another bank, and this deposit becomes a new source of credit for further loans.

### 5. **Providing Investment Services**

Banks also provide investment services, helping individuals and businesses invest their savings in different financial instruments. These include:

- **Mutual Funds**: Banks often act as intermediaries between investors and mutual fund managers.
- **Government Securities**: Banks facilitate the purchase and sale of government bonds and other securities.
- **Stocks and Bonds**: Banks may provide brokerage services to help customers buy and sell shares and bonds in the stock market.

By offering these services, banks help individuals and institutions manage their investments and grow their wealth.

## Secondary Functions of Banks

In addition to the primary functions mentioned above, banks also perform several secondary functions that contribute to the financial system's stability and growth.

### 1. **Agency Functions**

Banks act as agents for their customers and provide a variety of services, including:

- **Collection of Cheques**: Banks collect cheques on behalf of their customers.
- **Payment of Bills**: Banks can pay utility bills, insurance premiums, and taxes on behalf of clients.
- **Acting as Executors and Trustees**: Banks can act as executors of estates or trustees for managing trusts.

These agency functions save customers time and effort, helping them manage their financial transactions efficiently.

### 2. **Safekeeping and Custody Services**

Banks provide safe deposit vaults for the safekeeping of valuable items such as documents, jewelry, and other assets. These services ensure that clients' valuables are stored securely and safely.

### 3. **Foreign Exchange Services**

Banks facilitate the exchange of one currency for another and help businesses and individuals engage in international trade. This includes:

- **Currency Exchange**: Banks provide foreign currency to individuals and businesses.
- **Foreign Remittance**: Banks help in transferring money from one country to another.
- **Foreign Trade Financing**: Banks assist businesses in financing import and export transactions.

### 4. **Issuing Letters of Credit**

Banks issue **letters of credit (LC)** on behalf of their clients to guarantee payment for goods and services. This service is primarily used in international trade, ensuring that the seller receives payment as long as they meet the terms specified in the letter of credit.

6. **Legal Compliance**:
   In some cases, certain types of non-life insurance are mandatory. For example, **motor vehicle insurance** is legally required in many countries to ensure that drivers are financially responsible in case of accidents or damage.

7. **Protection Against Liability**:
   **Liability insurance** protects against legal costs or damages that may arise if a business or individual is held responsible for accidents, injuries, or property damage. This coverage helps protect against expensive lawsuits or claims.

8. **Economic Stability**:
   Non-life insurance contributes to the economic stability of individuals, businesses, and the overall economy by reducing the financial impact of risks and disasters. It ensures that resources can be allocated more efficiently during emergencies.

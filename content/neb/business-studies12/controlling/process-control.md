# Process of Control: Pre-control, Concurrent Control, and Post-control

The process of control in management is crucial for ensuring that the organization’s activities align with the established plans and objectives. The process involves monitoring and regulating performance at various stages. It can be divided into three primary stages: **Pre-control**, **Concurrent Control**, and **Post-control**. Each of these stages plays a distinct role in managing the performance of individuals and departments in an organization.

## 1. Pre-control

**Pre-control** refers to the control that occurs before an activity or process begins. It involves setting the standards, preparing resources, and ensuring that the necessary conditions are in place for smooth execution. This stage helps prevent problems from occurring and ensures that the plans and resources are aligned with the organization's goals.

### Key Features of Pre-control:

- **Setting Standards**: Establishing clear performance standards and expectations.
- **Resource Allocation**: Ensuring that resources (time, money, personnel) are allocated properly.
- **Planning and Preparation**: Making sure that everything is in place before starting an activity or task.

### Importance of Pre-control:

- **Prevention of Problems**: Helps in identifying potential problems before they occur.
- **Efficiency**: Ensures that tasks are carried out as planned, minimizing deviations.
- **Alignment with Goals**: Ensures that all activities align with the overall organizational objectives.

## 2. Concurrent Control

**Concurrent control** involves monitoring activities as they are being performed. This control is carried out during the execution phase of tasks and focuses on ensuring that things are progressing according to plan. Any discrepancies or deviations are identified in real-time, allowing for immediate corrective actions.

### Key Features of Concurrent Control:

- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuously tracking the progress of activities.
- **Real-time Corrections**: Making adjustments immediately if things are not going as planned.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Providing instant feedback to employees or teams during task execution.

### Importance of Concurrent Control:

- **Timely Intervention**: Allows managers to make corrections quickly, preventing minor issues from becoming larger problems.
- **Improved Performance**: Helps in maintaining a high level of performance during task execution.
- **Adaptability**: Provides flexibility to adjust strategies and actions during the process.

## 3. Post-control

**Post-control** occurs after the activity has been completed. This control stage focuses on evaluating the outcomes of the completed task or project. Managers compare the actual results with the planned objectives to assess performance. Based on this evaluation, corrective actions may be taken for future tasks or projects.

### Key Features of Post-control:

- **Performance Evaluation**: Comparing the actual performance with the set standards and objectives.
- **Outcome Analysis**: Analyzing the results to identify successes and failures.
- **Future Improvements**: Identifying lessons learned and areas for improvement in future projects.

### Importance of Post-control:

- **Corrective Action for Future**: Helps in taking corrective measures to prevent errors in future activities.
- **Performance Measurement**: Provides insight into how well the organization is performing relative to its goals.
- **Feedback for Improvement**: Offers valuable feedback for making strategic adjustments and improvements.

## Summary

The process of control involves three stages: **pre-control**, **concurrent control**, and **post-control**. Pre-control sets the foundation by planning and ensuring resources are in place, concurrent control ensures tasks are executed as planned, and post-control helps evaluate outcomes and improve future performance. All three stages work together to ensure the organization achieves its objectives efficiently and effectively.

## FAQs

### 1. What is pre-control in management?

Pre-control is the process of setting standards, preparing resources, and ensuring everything is in place before an activity begins. It helps prevent problems from occurring and ensures alignment with organizational goals.

### 2. How does concurrent control work?

Concurrent control involves monitoring and adjusting activities in real-time while they are being performed. It helps correct deviations immediately to keep tasks on track.

### 3. What is the role of post-control in the control process?

Post-control involves evaluating the outcomes after a task is completed, comparing actual performance with planned objectives, and taking corrective actions for future activities.

### 4. Why is pre-control important?

Pre-control is important because it ensures that resources are allocated correctly, standards are set, and activities are aligned with the organization’s objectives, preventing problems before they occur.

### 5. How does concurrent control improve performance?

# Telemarketing and Televised Marketing: Meaning and Features of Telephone and Televised Marketing; Problems and Prospects of Televised and Telemarketing in Nepal

Telemarketing and televised marketing are increasingly popular forms of direct marketing that use telephone calls and television ads to reach customers. These marketing methods offer various benefits and challenges, particularly in a growing economy like Nepal.

### Telemarketing: Meaning and Features

Telemarketing involves using the telephone to directly communicate with potential customers for selling products or services, conducting market research, or promoting offers. It can be conducted in two primary ways: inbound (receiving calls from customers) and outbound (making calls to potential customers).

#### Features of Telemarketing

1. **Direct Contact**: Telemarketing allows businesses to engage directly with customers, offering personalized communication.
2. **Cost-Effective**: Compared to traditional marketing methods like TV or print ads, telemarketing is relatively affordable.
3. **Real-Time Interaction**: Businesses can immediately address customer inquiries, resolve issues, and provide detailed product information.
4. **Targeted Marketing**: Telemarketing allows for more precise targeting of customers based on specific data, such as demographics or purchasing history.
5. **Customer Feedback**: Businesses can collect valuable feedback during calls, helping improve products and services.

### Televised Marketing: Meaning and Features

Televised marketing involves promoting products or services through television ads, including infomercials, product demonstrations, and advertisements on TV channels. It has been a significant tool in reaching a mass audience.

#### Features of Televised Marketing

1. **Wide Reach**: Television marketing reaches a large audience, including people of all demographics, making it a strong mass marketing tool.
2. **Visual Appeal**: TV ads can use visuals, sound, and demonstrations to effectively showcase products, making them more engaging for viewers.
3. **Credibility**: Television ads are often perceived as more trustworthy and authoritative compared to other forms of marketing.
4. **Influence on Consumer Behavior**: TV ads can influence viewers' purchase decisions by demonstrating the product's benefits and value.
5. **Scheduling Flexibility**: Ads can be scheduled at specific times to target particular audience segments (e.g., children’s products during afternoon shows, health products during late-night slots).

### Problems and Prospects of Telemarketing and Televised Marketing in Nepal

#### Problems of Telemarketing in Nepal

1. **Low Trust**: Many Nepali consumers have low trust in telemarketing, often viewing unsolicited calls as spam or fraud.
2. **Regulatory Challenges**: Nepal lacks comprehensive laws and regulations governing telemarketing practices, leading to unethical practices and consumer complaints.
3. **Language Barriers**: Nepal’s diverse linguistic landscape makes it challenging for telemarketing campaigns to effectively communicate with all segments of the population.
4. **High Operational Costs**: While telemarketing is generally cost-effective, the operational expenses related to maintaining call centers and training staff can be high.
5. **Limited Internet Access**: While telemarketing doesn't require the internet, its efficiency is reduced in areas where there is limited telephone infrastructure.

#### Prospects of Telemarketing in Nepal

1. **Growing Mobile Connectivity**: The increasing use of mobile phones in Nepal provides an opportunity for telemarketing to grow, especially in rural areas.

2. **Limited Channel Options**: The limited number of TV channels in Nepal, especially those that target specific demographic segments, restricts the reach of televised marketing.

4. **Over-Saturation of TV Ads**: With frequent commercials during TV shows, viewers may become desensitized or irritated, leading to a reduced effectiveness of televised marketing campaigns.

#### Prospects of Televised Marketing in Nepal

1. **Mass Audience Reach**: Despite high costs, television still reaches a large, diverse audience in Nepal, making it an effective marketing tool for large businesses.
2. **Rising TV Viewership**: The growing popularity of television, especially with the younger generation, provides a strong market for televised marketing.

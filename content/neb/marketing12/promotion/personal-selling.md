It is often considered a one-on-one interaction, where the salesperson’s primary goal is to convince the customer of the benefits of the product and facilitate a purchase.

### Importance of Personal Selling

### Types of Sales Process: Indoor Sales and Outdoor Sales

1. **Indoor Sales**  
   Indoor sales, also known as inside sales, refers to the process where sales activities are conducted within the business premises or office.

2. **Outdoor Sales**  
   Outdoor sales, also known as field sales or outside sales, involve the salesperson going outside the office or store to meet potential customers at their locations. This often includes face-to-face meetings, demonstrations, and negotiations at the customer's home, office, or other venues.

   - **Advantages**:
     - Personal interaction with customers in their environment
     - Ability to tailor presentations based on the customer’s needs

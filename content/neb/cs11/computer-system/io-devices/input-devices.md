# Input Devices – Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner, Light Pen, OMR, OCR, BCR, MICR, Scanner, Touch Screen, Microphone and Digital Camera

## What are Input Devices?

Input devices are hardware used to provide data and control signals to a computer system. They allow the user to interact with the system, inputting data for processing and output.

### Common Input Devices:

1. **Keyboard**
2. **Mouse**
3. **Scanner**
4. **Light Pen**
5. **OMR (Optical Mark Recognition)**
6. **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**
7. **BCR (Bar Code Reader)**
8. **MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition)**
9. **Touch Screen**
10. **Microphone**
11. **Digital Camera**

## Keyboard

A keyboard is a primary input device that allows the user to input text and commands into the computer by pressing keys. It includes keys for letters, numbers, symbols, and function keys.

### Key Features:

- **Types**: Mechanical, membrane, and optical keyboards.
- **Functionality**: Used for typing text, entering commands, and performing operations.

## Mouse

The mouse is a pointing device used to interact with the computer’s graphical user interface (GUI). It typically has two buttons and a scroll wheel for navigation.

### Key Features:

- **Functionality**: Move the cursor on the screen, select options, drag and drop files, and interact with applications.

## Scanner

A scanner is an input device that converts physical documents and images into digital format. It uses light-sensitive sensors to capture the image and transfer it to the computer.

### Key Features:

- **Types**: Flatbed scanners, handheld scanners, and drum scanners.
- **Functionality**: Used for digitizing printed text, photos, and graphics.

## Light Pen

A light pen is a pointing device that detects light emitted from a screen and sends the coordinates of the location to the computer. It is mainly used in graphical applications and design.

### Key Features:

- **Functionality**: Used for drawing or selecting items directly on a screen.

## OMR (Optical Mark Recognition)

OMR is used to detect marks made on paper, commonly used in forms such as surveys, exams, and ballots. It detects shaded or filled circles or boxes.

### Key Features:

- **Usage**: Used for scanning multiple-choice answer sheets, exams, and survey forms.

## OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

OCR is used to convert printed or handwritten text into machine-readable data. It is widely used in scanning documents and converting them into editable formats.

### Key Features:

- **Usage**: Converts scanned images of text into text data.

## BCR (Bar Code Reader)

A bar code reader is a device that scans barcodes (series of vertical lines) to decode the information encoded in the barcode.

### Key Features:

- **Usage**: Used in retail stores, libraries, and inventory management systems to track items.

## MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition)

MICR is used to read special ink characters on documents like checks. It reads magnetic ink characters that are printed at the bottom of checks or other banking documents.

### Key Features:

- **Usage**: Primarily used in the banking sector for processing checks.

## Touch Screen

A touch screen is a display device that allows the user to interact with the computer by touching the screen with their fingers or a stylus. It serves as both an input and output device.

### Key Features:

- **Usage**: Common in smartphones, tablets, ATMs, and kiosks.

## Microphone

A microphone is an audio input device used to capture sound and convert it into digital form for the computer to process. It is commonly used for voice recognition, video conferencing, and audio recording.

### Key Features:

- **Usage**: Used for voice input, recording sound, and communication applications.

## Digital Camera

A digital camera is used to capture photographs or videos in digital format. It converts light into electronic signals that are then stored as digital files.

### Key Features:

- **Usage**: Used for capturing images and videos for personal, professional, or media purposes.

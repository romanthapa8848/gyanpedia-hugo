# Decimal, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal Number System & Conversion

## What are Number Systems?

A number system is a writing system for expressing numbers. It uses a set of symbols or digits in a specific order to represent numbers. The most common number systems are Decimal, Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal.

### Common Number Systems:

1. **Decimal Number System (Base 10)**
2. **Binary Number System (Base 2)**
3. **Octal Number System (Base 8)**
4. **Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16)**

## Decimal Number System

The decimal number system is the most widely used system, based on 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This system is also known as the base 10 system.

### Conversion to Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal:

To convert from decimal to binary, octal, or hexadecimal, repeated division by the base of the target system is used, and the remainders are noted.

## Binary Number System

The binary number system uses only two digits: 0 and 1. It is the foundation of digital systems, as computers use binary to represent data.

### Conversion to Decimal, Octal, and Hexadecimal:

- To convert binary to decimal, multiply each bit by its corresponding power of 2 and sum the results.
- To convert binary to octal or hexadecimal, group the bits in sets of three or four and convert each group to its corresponding octal or hexadecimal value.

## Octal Number System

The octal number system is based on 8 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. It is often used in computing as a more compact way of expressing binary numbers.

### Conversion to Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal:

- To convert octal to decimal, multiply each digit by its corresponding power of 8 and sum the results.
- To convert octal to binary or hexadecimal, first convert to binary and then to hexadecimal.

## Hexadecimal Number System

The hexadecimal system is based on 16 digits: 0–9 and A–F (where A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15). It is widely used in computing for compact representation of binary data.

### Conversion to Decimal, Binary, and Octal:

- To convert hexadecimal to decimal, multiply each digit by its corresponding power of 16 and sum the results.
- To convert hexadecimal to binary or octal, first convert to binary and then to octal.

## Summary

Number systems like decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal are the foundation of computing. Understanding how to convert between them is crucial for various applications in computer science, particularly in programming and digital electronics. By using methods such as repeated division or groupings of digits, conversions between these systems can be performed efficiently.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the decimal number system?

The decimal number system is based on 10 digits: 0 to 9, and it is the most commonly used system in everyday life.

### 2. Why is the binary number system used in computers?

The binary number system is used in computers because it aligns with the two-state nature of digital circuits (on/off, true/false).

### 3. How do you convert a decimal number to binary?

To convert a decimal number to binary, divide the number by 2 repeatedly and write down the remainders in reverse order.

### 4. What is the use of the octal number system in computing?

The octal number system is often used as a shorthand for binary numbers, as it is easier to read and write.

### 5. How do you convert binary to hexadecimal?

To convert binary to hexadecimal, group the binary digits in sets of four and then convert each group into the corresponding hexadecimal value.

### 6. What is the hexadecimal number system used for?

The hexadecimal number system is commonly used in computing to represent binary data in a more compact and human-readable form.

### 7. How do you convert a number from octal to decimal?

To convert an octal number to decimal, multiply each digit by its corresponding power of 8 and sum the results.

### 8. What is the base of the binary number system?

The binary number system is based on 2, using only the digits 0 and 1.

### 9. Can the hexadecimal number system represent higher values than the decimal system?

No, hexadecimal is just another representation of values that can be expressed in decimal. It uses 16 symbols to represent values that are equivalent to the decimal system.

### 10. How do you convert hexadecimal to binary?

To convert hexadecimal to binary, replace each hexadecimal digit with its 4-bit binary equivalent.

# Vertical Zonation of Atmosphere

The Earth's atmosphere is divided into distinct vertical layers based on temperature changes and composition. Each layer has unique characteristics and plays a critical role in supporting life and regulating environmental processes.

## Layers of the Atmosphere

1. **Troposphere**:
   - **Height**: Up to 8-15 km (varies with latitude and season).
   - **Temperature**: Decreases with altitude (average lapse rate: 6.5°C/km).
   - **Significance**: Contains most of the atmospheric mass, weather phenomena, and life-supporting gases.

2. **Stratosphere**:
   - **Height**: 15-50 km.
   - **Temperature**: Increases with altitude due to ozone absorption of UV radiation.
   - **Significance**: Contains the ozone layer, protecting life from harmful UV rays.

3. **Mesosphere**:
   - **Height**: 50-85 km.
   - **Temperature**: Decreases with altitude (coldest layer).
   - **Significance**: Burns up meteors due to friction with atmospheric particles.

4. **Thermosphere**:
   - **Height**: 85-500 km.
   - **Temperature**: Increases with altitude (up to 2,500°C) due to solar radiation absorption.
   - **Significance**: Contains ionized particles, enabling communication via radio waves. The auroras occur here.

5. **Exosphere**:
   - **Height**: Above 500 km, merging with outer space.
   - **Temperature**: Extremely variable.
   - **Significance**: Contains sparse particles, mainly hydrogen and helium.

## Summary

The vertical zonation of the atmosphere consists of five main layers: the troposphere (weather and life), stratosphere (ozone layer), mesosphere (meteor burning), thermosphere (auroras and ionization), and exosphere (outermost layer). Each layer plays a unique role in maintaining Earth's climate and protecting life.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the troposphere?
The troposphere is the lowest atmospheric layer, where weather occurs and life-supporting gases exist.

### 2. Why does temperature decrease in the troposphere?
Temperature decreases with altitude due to reduced air pressure and heat retention.

### 3. What is the role of the stratosphere?
The stratosphere houses the ozone layer, which absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation.

### 4. Which atmospheric layer burns up meteors?
The mesosphere burns meteors due to friction with atmospheric particles.

### 5. What causes auroras in the thermosphere?
Auroras occur due to the interaction of solar wind with ionized particles in the thermosphere.

### 6. What is the exosphere?
The exosphere is the outermost atmospheric layer, gradually merging with space.

### 7. Why does temperature increase in the thermosphere?
Temperature increases due to absorption of intense solar radiation by ionized gases.

### 8. How high does the stratosphere extend?
The stratosphere extends up to about 50 km above Earth's surface.

### 9. What gases are found in the exosphere?
The exosphere contains sparse hydrogen and helium atoms.

### 10. Which layer is the coldest in the atmosphere?
The mesosphere is the coldest layer of the atmosphere.

# Atmospheric Composition

The atmosphere is a mixture of gases, particles, and water vapor that surrounds the Earth. It is essential for sustaining life and regulating environmental processes. Each component of the atmosphere plays a critical role in maintaining the Earth's ecosystem balance.

## Key Components of Atmospheric Composition:

1. **Major Gases**:
   - **Nitrogen (N₂)**: 78% - Crucial for protein formation in living organisms.
   - **Oxygen (O₂)**: 21% - Essential for respiration and combustion processes.
   - **Argon (Ar)**: 0.93% - An inert gas with no direct role in biological processes.

2. **Minor Gases**:
   - **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**: 0.04% - Vital for photosynthesis and a key greenhouse gas.
   - **Methane (CH₄)**: Trace amounts - A potent greenhouse gas contributing to global warming.

3. **Trace Gases**:
   - Includes neon, helium, krypton, hydrogen, and ozone (O₃).

4. **Water Vapor (H₂O)**:
   - Variable concentration (0-4%) - Plays a significant role in the water cycle and weather patterns.

5. **Aerosols**:
   - Small particles of dust, soot, and salt that influence cloud formation and solar radiation.

6. **Ozone (O₃)**:
   - Found mainly in the stratosphere, it protects life by absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation.

## Summary

The Earth's atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, along with smaller amounts of argon, carbon dioxide, and trace gases. Water vapor and aerosols contribute to weather, climate, and radiation processes. This composition is vital for life on Earth, but human activities are altering its balance, leading to environmental challenges.

# Procedure of Registration and Renewals of Sole Trading Concern in Nepal

Starting a **sole trading concern** in Nepal involves a straightforward registration process with the government authorities. In addition to initial registration, businesses also need to renew their registration periodically to stay compliant with the law. Here’s an overview of the process for both registration and renewals.

### 1. **Initial Registration of a Sole Trading Concern**

To legally operate a sole trading concern in Nepal, the following steps must be taken for registration:

#### Step 1: **Name Reservation**

The first step in the registration process is to **reserve the name** of the business. This can be done by applying to the **Office of the Company Registrar (OCR)**, ensuring the proposed business name is unique and available.

#### Step 2: **Obtain a Citizenship Certificate**

The owner of the sole trading concern must provide a copy of their **Nepali citizenship certificate** as proof of identity. This is a key document required to verify the legal status of the business owner.

#### Step 3: **Register at the Local Municipality**

The business owner must then **register the business at the local municipality** where the business will operate. The municipality issues a **business registration certificate** after reviewing the business details.

#### Step 4: **Apply for a PAN (Permanent Account Number)**

A **PAN** is required for tax purposes. Sole traders must apply for a **PAN certificate** from the **Inland Revenue Department** (IRD). This enables the business to be taxed appropriately under the **Income Tax Act of Nepal**.

#### Step 5: **Obtain a Business License**

Once registered at the local municipality and with the PAN, the next step is to obtain a **business license** from the concerned authority. Depending on the type of business, different licenses may be required, such as a **trade license** or **industry license**.

#### Step 6: **Social Security Fund Registration**

Sole traders must also register with the **Social Security Fund (SSF)**, especially if they plan to employ staff. This is essential for contributing to the **Social Security Fund** on behalf of employees.

#### Step 7: **Register for VAT (if applicable)**

If the business's annual turnover exceeds the prescribed threshold (usually **NPR 5 million**), the business must register for **Value Added Tax (VAT)** with the **Inland Revenue Department**.

#### Step 8: **Other Necessary Permits and Registrations**

Depending on the nature of the business, additional permits or registrations may be required. For example, if the business is involved in food, health, or tourism sectors, special permits from relevant government agencies may be required.

### 2. **Renewal of Sole Trading Concern Registration**

The registration of a sole trading concern in Nepal is typically valid for **one year**, after which it must be renewed. The procedure for renewal is as follows:

#### Step 1: **Prepare Necessary Documents**

The business owner needs to prepare the following documents for the renewal process:

- **Business registration certificate**
- **PAN certificate**
- **Tax clearance certificate** (if applicable)
- **VAT registration certificate** (if applicable)
- **Social Security Fund registration** (if applicable)

#### Step 2: **Renew the Business License**

The business owner must approach the **local municipality** where the business is registered to renew the **business license**. The renewal fee will depend on the nature and scale of the business. After verification, the municipality will issue a renewed license.

#### Step 3: **File Annual Returns**

The business must file an **annual return** with the **Inland Revenue Department** to confirm the business’s financial activities over the past year. This helps ensure that the business is compliant with tax laws and that all taxes owed are paid.

#### Step 4: **Renewal of Social Security Fund (SSF) Registration**

If applicable, the business must also **renew its Social Security Fund (SSF) registration** to ensure continued contributions on behalf of employees.

#### Step 5: **Payment of Taxes**

The business owner must ensure that all taxes, including income tax, VAT, and any other relevant taxes, are paid up to date. If the business has outstanding tax liabilities, the renewal process may be delayed until these liabilities are cleared.

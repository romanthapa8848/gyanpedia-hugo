# Company Meetings

In the context of company management, meetings are a critical part of decision-making and governance. They provide a platform for shareholders, directors, and other key stakeholders to discuss the company’s affairs, make important decisions, and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory frameworks. In Nepal, company meetings are governed by the **Companies Act, 2006** and other relevant regulations.

## Types of Company Meetings

### 1. **Annual General Meeting (AGM)**

The **Annual General Meeting (AGM)** is one of the most important meetings for any company. It is a statutory meeting where shareholders discuss the company’s performance, financial statements, and elect directors. The AGM must be held once every year.

### 2. **Board of Directors Meeting**

The **Board of Directors Meeting** is conducted by the board members to discuss and make decisions on various strategic, operational, and financial matters related to the company. It is typically held more frequently than the AGM.

### 4. **Class Meetings**

**Class Meetings** are meetings held for specific classes of shareholders, typically to discuss matters that affect only that class. For instance, **preference shareholders** may hold a meeting to discuss issues related to their class of shares.

#### Importance:

- Necessary when certain decisions or proposals impact only specific classes of shareholders.
- Helps in making decisions that affect the rights and interests of particular shareholders.

#### Regulations:

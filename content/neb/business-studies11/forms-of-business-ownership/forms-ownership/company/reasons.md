# Reasons for Starting a Company Business

Starting a company business offers various benefits that make it an attractive option for entrepreneurs and business owners. The decision to form a company is often based on the desire to limit personal liability, raise capital, and have the opportunity for growth and expansion. In Nepal, the **Companies Act, 2006** governs the creation and management of companies. Below are some of the key reasons for starting a company business:

## 1. **Limited Liability Protection**

One of the most significant reasons for starting a company is the **limited liability** protection it offers to its shareholders. In the case of a company, the shareholders' liability is restricted to the amount they have invested in the company. This means that personal assets of the shareholders (owners) are not at risk if the company faces financial troubles or goes bankrupt.

## 2. **Access to Capital**

A company, especially a **public company**, has the ability to raise capital by issuing **shares** and **debentures** to the public. **Private companies** can also raise capital through private placements or loans from financial institutions. This ability to raise large amounts of capital is essential for expanding business operations, investing in new projects, and funding growth.

## 3. **Perpetual Succession**

Companies enjoy **perpetual succession**, meaning the business continues to exist even if the ownership or management changes. The company's existence is not affected by the death, bankruptcy, or incapacity of its shareholders or directors. This provides stability and long-term planning potential, which is essential for business continuity.

## 4. **Credibility and Trust**

Being a registered company often enhances the **credibility** and **reputation** of the business in the eyes of customers, suppliers, and investors. It gives the impression of a more established and serious business entity compared to unincorporated businesses such as sole proprietorships or partnerships. This can help attract better clients, partnerships, and financing opportunities.

## 5. **Separation of Ownership and Management**

In a company, the **ownership** and **management** are separated. Shareholders own the company through their shares, while the company is managed by a board of directors. This allows for professional management, enabling the company to operate more efficiently and focus on long-term strategic goals, rather than being dependent on a single owner.

## 6. **Tax Benefits**

Companies are often eligible for certain **tax advantages** that are not available to individuals or other types of business structures. For example, in many countries, companies can claim tax deductions on business expenses, which reduces their taxable income. Additionally, companies can benefit from lower corporate tax rates compared to personal income tax rates.

## 7. **Attracting and Retaining Talented Employees**

A company business structure can provide better **employee benefits**, such as stock options, retirement plans, and performance bonuses, which help in attracting and retaining talented employees. This is especially true for larger companies, where employees can also benefit from a more organized and structured workplace environment.

## 8. **Easier Transfer of Ownership**

Ownership in a company can be **easily transferred** through the sale or transfer of shares. This provides flexibility for business owners who wish to exit the business or bring in new investors or partners. This ease of transfer is not available in other business structures like sole proprietorships or partnerships, where ownership transfer can be complicated and time-consuming.

## 9. **Risk Diversification**

By forming a company, owners can diversify their personal and business risks. Since the company is a separate legal entity, its debts and liabilities do not affect the personal assets of the shareholders. This helps reduce the financial risk for the owners and encourages them to invest more in business growth.

## 10. **Opportunity for Expansion**

Starting a company provides an excellent opportunity for **business expansion**. Companies can expand into new markets, enter into strategic partnerships, and launch new products or services with the backing of capital and resources. Additionally, companies can attract funding from venture capitalists, angel investors, and banks for expansion.

## Summary

Starting a company offers several key benefits, such as **limited liability protection**, access to **capital**, and **perpetual succession**. It helps build credibility, facilitates business expansion, and offers tax advantages. Companies also provide the flexibility to separate ownership from management and attract talented employees. These features make companies an attractive business structure for entrepreneurs who want to limit personal risk and scale their operations.

# Procedure of Registration and Renewal of Partnership Firm in Nepal

In Nepal, registering and renewing a partnership firm is a legal requirement to operate a business officially. The registration process ensures the legal recognition of the partnership and helps in resolving disputes, if any, between partners. This section provides a detailed guide on how to register and renew a partnership firm in Nepal.

## Procedure for Registration of a Partnership Firm in Nepal

### 1. **Choose a Business Name**

The first step in registering a partnership firm is to choose a **unique name** for the business. The name should not resemble the name of any existing business entity and must be approved by the concerned authorities.

### 2. **Draft a Partnership Deed**

A **Partnership Deed** is an essential document that defines the roles, responsibilities, profit-sharing ratios, and other terms between the partners. It can be prepared with or without the assistance of a legal professional, although it's recommended to seek legal advice to ensure the document covers all necessary aspects.

### 3. **Submit the Partnership Deed**

Once the deed is drafted, it must be signed by all the partners in front of a witness. The deed is then **submitted to the Department of Industry (DOI)** along with other required documents.

### 4. **Required Documents for Registration**

The following documents are typically required to register a partnership firm in Nepal:

- **Application form** (available at the Department of Industry or online)
- **Partnership deed** (signed by all partners)
- **Photocopy of citizenship certificates** of all partners
- **Office address proof** (such as a lease agreement or property ownership document)
- **Passport-sized photographs** of all partners
- **Revenue stamp** for the partnership deed

### 5. **Obtain a Registration Certificate**

After the submission of the required documents, the Department of Industry will verify the information and issue a **registration certificate** for the partnership firm. This certificate officially recognizes the business as a legal entity and authorizes it to operate within the scope of the partnership agreement.

### 6. **Register for PAN (Permanent Account Number)**

Once the partnership firm is registered, it must apply for a **PAN number** at the Inland Revenue Department (IRD). This is necessary for tax purposes and the firm’s legal recognition.

### 7. **Register with the Municipality or Rural Municipality**

In addition to the central registration, the partnership firm must also be registered with the local **municipality or rural municipality** to comply with local regulations.

### 8. **Apply for Other Licenses (If Required)**

Depending on the type of business, certain **special licenses or permits** may be required. These can be applied for from the respective regulatory bodies, such as the Department of Commerce, Health, or others, depending on the business nature.

## Procedure for Renewal of a Partnership Firm in Nepal

- **Change in business address**

In such cases, the firm must file for **renewal** or **update** with the Department of Industry and submit the revised partnership deed and supporting documents.

### 2. **Renewal of PAN Number**

The **PAN number** needs to be renewed periodically. The renewal process includes updating any business changes with the Inland Revenue Department. A new **Tax Clearance Certificate** is also required annually.

### 3. **File Annual Tax Returns**

The partnership firm must file **annual tax returns** with the Inland Revenue Department. The tax returns must be filed on time to avoid penalties and ensure compliance with the tax laws in Nepal.

### 4. **Renewal of Local Licenses**

If the firm operates in a regulated sector, it may be required to renew **local business licenses** with the municipality or rural municipality on an annual basis.

### 5. **Keep Documents Updated**

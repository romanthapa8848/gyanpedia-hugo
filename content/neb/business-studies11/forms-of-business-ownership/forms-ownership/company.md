# Company

A **company** is a legal entity that is distinct from its owners, created for the purpose of carrying out business activities. It is a separate entity that can own property, incur debts, and be sued in its name. In Nepal, companies are primarily governed by the **Companies Act, 2006**, which defines their types, formation process, and operational structure. Companies are usually formed for profit-making purposes, and their ownership is divided into shares held by shareholders.

## Features of a Company

- **Separate Legal Entity**: A company is recognized as a separate legal entity from its shareholders and directors. It can own assets, enter into contracts, and be liable for its own debts.

- **Limited Liability**: Shareholders' liability is limited to the amount unpaid on their shares. This means their personal assets are protected if the company fails.

- **Perpetual Succession**: The company continues to exist even if its shareholders or directors change, making it a permanent entity unless formally dissolved.

- **Transferability of Shares**: In most types of companies, shareholders can transfer their shares to others without much restriction.

- **Centralized Management**: Companies are managed by a board of directors elected by the shareholders. This provides professional management for day-to-day operations.

- **Capital Raising**: A company can raise capital by issuing shares to the public (in case of public companies) or to a limited group of individuals (in private companies).

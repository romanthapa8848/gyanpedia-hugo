# Mechanism of Photosynthesis (Photochemical Phase and Calvin-Benson Cycle)

Photosynthesis is the process through which plants convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. The mechanism of photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the **Photochemical Phase (Light Reaction)** and the **Calvin-Benson Cycle (Dark Reaction)**.

## Photochemical Phase (Light Reaction)

The photochemical phase, also known as the light-dependent reaction, occurs in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts. It requires light to produce ATP and NADPH, which are used in the Calvin-Benson Cycle.

### Key Steps in the Photochemical Phase

1. **Absorption of Light**: Chlorophyll and other pigments absorb light energy, exciting electrons to a higher energy state.
2. **Photolysis of Water**: Light energy splits water molecules (H₂O) into oxygen (O₂), protons (H⁺), and electrons (e⁻).
   - Reaction: $ 2H_2O → 4H^+ + 4e^- + O_2 $
3. **Electron Transport Chain (ETC)**: Excited electrons travel through the ETC, releasing energy that helps convert ADP to ATP.
4. **Formation of NADPH**: Electrons reduce NADP⁺ to form NADPH, which will be used in the Calvin-Benson Cycle.
5. **Production of ATP**: Through chemiosmosis, the energy from the ETC is used to form ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi).

### Summary of Products

- **ATP and NADPH**: These energy-rich molecules are produced and will be used in the Calvin-Benson Cycle.
- **Oxygen (O₂)**: Released as a byproduct of photolysis.

## Calvin-Benson Cycle (Dark Reaction)

The Calvin-Benson Cycle, also known as the dark reaction or light-independent reaction, occurs in the stroma of the chloroplasts. It does not require light directly but uses ATP and NADPH produced in the photochemical phase.

### Key Steps in the Calvin-Benson Cycle

1. **Carbon Fixation**: CO₂ combines with a 5-carbon compound, ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), forming a 6-carbon molecule that splits into two 3-carbon molecules, 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA).
2. **Reduction Phase**: Using ATP and NADPH, PGA is converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a 3-carbon sugar.
3. **Regeneration of RuBP**: Most G3P molecules are used to regenerate RuBP, allowing the cycle to continue. This step requires ATP.

### Summary of Products

- **Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)**: After multiple cycles, G3P molecules combine to form glucose.
- **ADP and NADP⁺**: These are regenerated and returned to the photochemical phase for reuse.

# Parathyroid Gland: Structure & Functions

The **parathyroid glands** are small, oval-shaped endocrine glands located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland in the neck. There are typically four parathyroid glands, two on each side of the thyroid gland. These glands play a crucial role in regulating calcium and phosphate levels in the body through the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH).

### Structure:

The parathyroid glands are usually about the size of a grain of rice and are embedded within the thyroid tissue. The glands are typically located behind the thyroid gland, two on each side of the thyroid's lobes. The parathyroid glands are composed of chief cells, which are responsible for producing parathyroid hormone, and oxyphil cells, which have an unclear function.

### Functions:

The parathyroid glands secrete **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)**, which is essential for maintaining the balance of calcium and phosphate in the blood. PTH is the primary regulator of calcium levels, and it has several key functions:

1. **Regulation of Blood Calcium Levels**:
   The main function of PTH is to raise blood calcium levels by stimulating the release of calcium from bones, increasing calcium reabsorption by the kidneys, and promoting the activation of vitamin D, which increases calcium absorption from the intestine.
2. **Bone Resorption**:
   PTH stimulates osteoclasts, the cells responsible for breaking down bone tissue, which releases calcium into the bloodstream. This process is crucial when calcium levels in the blood are low.
3. **Kidney Function**:
   PTH promotes the reabsorption of calcium by the kidneys, preventing excessive loss of calcium through urine. It also reduces the reabsorption of phosphate in the kidneys, leading to a decrease in blood phosphate levels.
4. **Activation of Vitamin D**:
   PTH stimulates the kidneys to convert vitamin D into its active form (calcitriol), which enhances calcium absorption from the intestines.

5. **Calcium-Phosphate Balance**:
   PTH works together with calcitonin (produced by the thyroid gland) to maintain the proper balance between calcium and phosphate in the body. While PTH increases blood calcium levels, calcitonin lowers them.

### Key Functions of PTH:

1. **Increase blood calcium levels**
2. **Promote bone resorption**
3. **Enhance calcium reabsorption by kidneys**
4. **Activate vitamin D for calcium absorption**
5. **Maintain calcium-phosphate balance**

## Summary

The parathyroid glands are critical for regulating calcium levels in the body. Through the secretion of **parathyroid hormone (PTH)**, the parathyroid glands influence bone health, kidney function, and calcium absorption in the intestine, thus ensuring the maintenance of proper calcium and phosphate balance.

## FAQs

### 1. What hormone is produced by the parathyroid glands?

The parathyroid glands produce **parathyroid hormone (PTH)**, which regulates calcium levels in the body.

### 2. Where are the parathyroid glands located?

The parathyroid glands are located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland, typically two on each side.

### 3. What is the primary function of parathyroid hormone (PTH)?

The primary function of PTH is to raise blood calcium levels by stimulating bone resorption, increasing calcium reabsorption in the kidneys, and promoting vitamin D activation.

### 4. How does PTH affect bones?

PTH stimulates osteoclasts, which break down bone tissue and release calcium into the bloodstream.

### 5. What role does PTH play in kidney function?

PTH promotes calcium reabsorption by the kidneys, preventing calcium loss through urine, and decreases phosphate reabsorption, leading to lower phosphate levels in the blood.

### 6. How does PTH influence vitamin D?

PTH stimulates the kidneys to convert vitamin D into its active form (calcitriol), which enhances calcium absorption in the intestines.

### 7. What happens if there is too much parathyroid hormone?

Excessive parathyroid hormone can lead to hypercalcemia, which may cause symptoms like fatigue, weakness, kidney stones, and osteoporosis.

### 8. What happens if there is too little parathyroid hormone?

Insufficient parathyroid hormone can lead to hypocalcemia, causing muscle cramps, tingling in the hands and feet, and seizures.

### 9. How does PTH work with calcitonin?

PTH raises blood calcium levels, while calcitonin, produced by the thyroid gland, lowers blood calcium levels, helping to maintain a proper calcium-phosphate balance.

### 10. What is the relationship between PTH and bone health?

PTH plays a role in maintaining bone health by regulating calcium release from bones, helping to ensure proper calcium levels in the blood.

# Demand: Concept of Needs, Drive, Wants, and Demand - Creation of Demand

In marketing, **demand** refers to the consumer's desire to purchase goods and services backed by their purchasing power. Demand is closely related to human needs and wants and is influenced by various factors, including the availability of money and personal preferences. Understanding how needs, drives, and wants evolve into demand is crucial for businesses to develop strategies that attract customers and drive sales.

## Concept of Needs, Drive, Wants, and Demand

### 1. **Needs**

A need is a basic requirement for human survival or well-being. It is something essential for living and is not influenced by external factors. Needs are inherent and can be categorized into two types:

- **Primary Needs**: These are physiological needs, such as food, water, shelter, and clothing, which are fundamental for human survival.
- **Secondary Needs**: These are psychological needs, such as the need for belonging, self-esteem, and love, which are influenced by social and cultural factors.

For example, the need for food and water is a primary need, while the need for social interaction or status is a secondary need.

### 2. **Drive**

Drive refers to a strong feeling or urge that pushes an individual to take action in order to satisfy their needs. It is the internal force that motivates a person to fulfill a need. For instance, the need for food may create the drive to eat, or the need for social connection may create the drive to engage in conversations or relationships.

### 3. **Wants**

Wants are desires shaped by cultural, social, and individual influences. While needs are universal and essential, wants are specific to an individual and are influenced by personal preferences, tastes, and experiences. Wants are often more diverse and can evolve with time.

For example:

- A person may need food, but they may want a particular type of food like pizza, burgers, or sushi based on their preferences.
- A person may need clothing, but they may want fashionable or designer clothes.

### 4. **Demand**

Demand is the desire for a product or service combined with the ability and willingness to pay for it. It is not enough for consumers to simply want something; they must also have the purchasing power to buy it. In marketing terms, demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at a given price.

**Key Characteristics of Demand:**

- **Willingness**: Consumers must have the desire to purchase the product.
- **Ability**: Consumers must have the financial capacity to make the purchase.
- **Market Conditions**: Demand is affected by factors like income, advertising, and price fluctuations.

## Creation of Demand

Creating demand is an essential task for marketers, as it drives sales and business growth. To create demand, businesses need to understand the needs, wants, and behaviors of their target audience and develop strategies to encourage purchase. The following are key methods for creating demand:

### 1. **Identifying Customer Needs**

Businesses must first understand the needs of their target market. By identifying unmet needs or improving existing solutions, companies can develop products that satisfy these needs, which will naturally create demand.

#### Example:

A company might identify a need for healthier snacks among health-conscious consumers. By introducing a range of nutritious, low-calorie snacks, they can cater to this need and create demand.

### 2. **Transforming Needs into Wants**

Once a company identifies a need, it must shape that need into a want. This is done through marketing, branding, and creating awareness about how the product or service can fulfill the consumer's desires. The more effectively a company can position its product, the more it can turn a basic need into a strong want.

#### Example:

A bottled water company might emphasize purity, flavor, and convenience, transforming the simple need for water into a desire for premium, flavored water.

### 3. **Building Awareness and Interest**

Effective marketing strategies, such as advertising, social media campaigns, and promotions, help build awareness and generate interest in a product. By making consumers aware of the product and its benefits, companies can trigger demand.

#### Example:

A new smartphone with unique features might be advertised extensively to create interest and demand from tech enthusiasts who are eager to try the latest gadgets.

### 4. **Creating Perceived Value**

Consumers are more likely to demand products that they perceive to have high value, whether it's in terms of quality, price, or experience. Marketers can create value by offering quality products, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.

#### Example:

A company offering a high-quality pair of shoes with a satisfaction guarantee can create perceived value and, as a result, generate demand for its product.

### 5. **Improving Accessibility**

Ensuring that products are easily accessible to consumers can stimulate demand. This could mean expanding distribution channels, offering online purchasing options, or ensuring products are available at convenient locations.

#### Example:

A company that makes its products available in both physical stores and online platforms can reach a broader audience, thus creating greater demand.

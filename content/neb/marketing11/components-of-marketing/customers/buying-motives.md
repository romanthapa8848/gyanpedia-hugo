## Meaning of Buying Motives

A **buying motive** is a psychological factor or a need that encourages consumers to make a decision to purchase a product or service. These motives stem from both external factors, like advertising, and internal factors, like personal preferences and emotional needs. Buyers typically do not act randomly; their purchases are often driven by an underlying motive, whether it’s to satisfy a specific need, enjoy a luxury, or make a rational investment.

Understanding the buying motives of consumers helps marketers to predict consumer behavior and design marketing strategies that address these needs.

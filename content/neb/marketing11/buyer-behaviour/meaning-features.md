# Meaning and Features of Buyer and Buyer Behaviour

Buyer behavior refers to the actions, decision-making processes, and factors that influence the purchasing decisions of individuals or organizations. Understanding buyer behavior is critical for marketers to design effective marketing strategies and meet consumer needs efficiently. Buyer behavior can vary based on personal preferences, psychological factors, cultural influences, and social settings.

## Meaning of Buyer

A buyer is any individual or entity (such as a consumer or an organization) that makes a purchase decision to acquire goods or services. The buyer can be:

- **Individual Buyer**: An individual who purchases products or services for personal use, based on their needs, desires, and preferences.
- **Organizational Buyer**: A business or government entity that purchases goods or services to produce products, support operations, or serve a specific business function.

## Features of Buyer Behaviour

### 1. **Complex Decision-Making Process**

Buyer behavior involves a multi-step process, starting from recognizing a need to evaluating alternatives, making a purchase, and post-purchase behavior. The complexity of this process depends on the nature of the product, the buyer’s knowledge, and the significance of the purchase.

- **Example**: A person buying a smartphone will go through various stages such as recognizing the need for a new phone, researching brands, comparing features, and making the final purchase decision.

### 2. **Influenced by Psychological Factors**

Psychological factors such as perception, motivation, learning, beliefs, and attitudes play a significant role in shaping buyer behavior. For instance, a consumer's perception of a brand's quality and value can heavily influence their buying decision.

- **Example**: A consumer may prefer a particular brand of shoes because of positive past experiences or the brand's reputation for quality.

### 3. **Social and Cultural Influences**

A buyer’s behavior is influenced by social and cultural factors, including family, friends, social groups, and cultural norms. Social class, lifestyle, and peer pressure can also affect the decision-making process.

- **Example**: People may purchase certain products to fit in with a specific social group or to meet cultural expectations, such as buying eco-friendly products due to social pressures to act responsibly.

### 4. **Personal Factors**

Personal factors such as age, income, occupation, lifestyle, and personality influence buying behavior. A younger consumer with higher disposable income might purchase different products than an older consumer with a fixed income.

- **Example**: A teenager might purchase trendy clothing or gadgets, while an older adult may prioritize functional and durable products for daily use.

### 5. **Economic Influences**

Economic factors, such as the availability of disposable income, the state of the economy, and purchasing power, greatly affect consumer buying behavior. A strong economy may lead to increased spending, while a recession may cause consumers to cut back on non-essential purchases.

- **Example**: During times of economic uncertainty, consumers may focus more on essential goods and services rather than luxury items.

### 6. **Buying Patterns and Habits**

Buyers develop certain purchasing habits based on past experiences, brand loyalty, and convenience. Some may be habitual buyers of a particular brand or product, while others may switch brands based on offers, discounts, or availability.

- **Example**: A consumer who regularly buys a specific brand of coffee may continue purchasing it due to brand loyalty, despite a competitor’s new offering.

### 7. **Decision-Making Style**

Different buyers have distinct decision-making styles. Some buyers may make decisions quickly, while others may deliberate for a longer time, especially for high-involvement purchases.

- **Example**: A consumer buying a simple product, like toothpaste, may make a quick decision, but purchasing a car may involve extensive research and comparison of features, prices, and brands.

### 8. **Post-Purchase Behaviour**

After making a purchase, buyers experience post-purchase behavior, which includes their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the product. If satisfied, they are likely to repeat the purchase and may recommend the product to others. If dissatisfied, they may return the product or share negative feedback.

- **Example**: If a customer buys a new laptop and finds it to be underperforming, they may feel dissatisfied and return the product or share a negative review.

### 9. **Influence of External Environment**

External factors like advertising, promotions, social media, and other marketing communications significantly influence buyer behavior. Advertisements, for example, can create awareness and persuade consumers to consider a brand or product.

- **Example**: A catchy ad campaign can influence a customer to purchase a product they may not have considered otherwise.

### 10. **Needs and Motivation**

At the core of buyer behavior is the need and motivation behind the purchase. Marketers often focus on identifying consumer needs and motivations to design products that will attract buyers. A customer’s motivation could be functional (solving a problem) or emotional (feeling good about the purchase).

- **Example**: A customer may buy a high-end watch for status and luxury (emotional motivation) or buy a budget-friendly model to serve practical needs (functional motivation).

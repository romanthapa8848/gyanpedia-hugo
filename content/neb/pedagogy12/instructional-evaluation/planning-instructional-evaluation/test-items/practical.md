## Types of Practical Work-Based Assessments

1. **Laboratory Experiments**

   - Students perform experiments to demonstrate their understanding of scientific principles and procedures.

2. **Fieldwork**

   - Students gather data or perform tasks in real-world environments (e.g., ecological surveys, interviews).

3. **Skill Demonstrations**

   - Students showcase specific skills, such as operating equipment or conducting a process.

4. **Simulations**

   - Students engage in role-play or computer-based simulations to practice real-world scenarios.

5. **Project-Based Assessments**
   - Students undertake projects requiring the application of knowledge and skills to create tangible outputs.

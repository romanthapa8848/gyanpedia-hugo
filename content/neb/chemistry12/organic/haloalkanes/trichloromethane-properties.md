# Chemical Properties of Trichloromethane

Trichloromethane, also known as **chloroform**, exhibits several chemical properties when it reacts with various reagents. The following are some of the key reactions:

## 1. **Oxidation of Trichloromethane**
Trichloromethane undergoes **oxidation** in the presence of strong oxidizing agents, such as potassium permanganate ($\ce{KMnO_4}$), to form **carbonyl compounds** such as formic acid ($\ce{HCOOH}$) and carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO_2}$).

### Reaction:
$$\ce{CHCl_3 + 2KMnO_4 + 2H_2O \longrightarrow HCOOH + CO_2 + 2MnO_2 + 2KCl}$$

## 2. **Reduction of Trichloromethane**
Trichloromethane is reduced to **methane** ($\ce{CH_4}$) in the presence of reducing agents like zinc and hydrochloric acid ($\ce{Zn/HCl}$).

### Reaction:
$$\ce{CHCl_3 + 4H_2 \longrightarrow CH_4 + 3HCl}$$

## 3. **Action on Silver Powder**
When trichloromethane reacts with **silver powder** ($\ce{Ag}$), it undergoes **dechlorination** to form **methane** and **silver chloride** ($\ce{AgCl}$) as a by-product.

### Reaction:
$$\ce{CHCl_3 + Ag \longrightarrow CH_4 + AgCl}$$

## 4. **Action with Concentrated Nitric Acid**
Trichloromethane reacts with **concentrated nitric acid** ($\ce{HNO_3}$) to form **nitro compounds**, such as **nitrochloroform** ($\ce{CCl_3NO_2}$).

### Reaction:
$$\ce{CHCl_3 + HNO_3 \longrightarrow CCl_3NO_2 + H_2O}$$

## 5. **Action with Propanone**
Trichloromethane reacts with **propanone** (acetone) in the presence of a base to form **chloroformyl acetone** and other products. This reaction is typically carried out under **basic conditions**.

### Reaction:
$$\ce{CHCl_3 + CH_3COCH_3 + NaOH \longrightarrow CHCl_2COCH_3 + NaCl + H_2O}$$

## 6. **Action with Aqueous Alkali**
Trichloromethane undergoes **dehydrohalogenation** in the presence of **aqueous alkali** (like sodium hydroxide, $\ce{NaOH}$), forming **dichlorocarbene** ($\ce{CCl_2}$), which is highly reactive and can further undergo various reactions.

### Reaction:
$$\ce{CHCl_3 + NaOH \longrightarrow CCl_2 + NaCl + H_2O}$$

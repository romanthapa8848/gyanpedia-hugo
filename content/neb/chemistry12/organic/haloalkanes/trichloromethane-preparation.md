# Preparation of Trichloromethane from Ethanol and Propanone

Trichloromethane, commonly known as chloroform, is an important organic compound with several industrial applications. It can be prepared from ethanol and propanone through chlorination reactions. Below are the two main methods for synthesizing trichloromethane.

## 1. Preparation of Trichloromethane from Ethanol

Ethanol can be converted to trichloromethane by **chlorination** in the presence of an oxidizing agent such as chlorine gas ($\ce{Cl_2}$) or phosphorus trichloride ($\ce{PCl_3}$). This process occurs in multiple steps:

### Reaction Mechanism
1. **Chlorination of ethanol**:
   Ethanol ($\ce{CH_3CH_2OH}$) reacts with chlorine gas ($\ce{Cl_2}$) in the presence of UV light or a catalyst.

2. **Stepwise Chlorination**:
   - First, ethanol undergoes halogenation to form **chloroethanol** ($\ce{CH_3CH_2Cl}$).
   - Second, further chlorination leads to the formation of **dichloroethanol**.
   - Finally, oxidative chlorination results in the formation of **chloroform** ($\ce{CHCl_3}$).

### Reaction:
$$\ce{CH_3CH_2OH + 3Cl_2 \longrightarrow CHCl_3 + 2HCl + 2H_2O}$$

**Products**:
- **Trichloromethane (chloroform)** ($\ce{CHCl_3}$)
- **Hydrochloric acid** ($\ce{HCl}$)
- **Water** ($\ce{H_2O}$)

## 2. Preparation of Trichloromethane from Propanone

Propane ($\ce{CH_3COCH_3}$) can also be converted into trichloromethane by reacting with chlorine in the presence of an appropriate catalyst. This reaction generally involves the **halogenation of propanone** at the carbonyl group, followed by further chlorination steps to yield chloroform.

### Reaction Mechanism:
- In the presence of chlorine gas and light, propanone reacts to form **trichloromethane**.
- The process involves the **substitution of hydrogen atoms** in propanone with chlorine atoms, producing **chloroform** as the primary product.

### Reaction:
$$\ce{CH_3COCH_3 + 3Cl_2 \longrightarrow CHCl_3 + 2HCl + 2CH_3OH}$$

**Products**:
- **Trichloromethane (chloroform)** ($\ce{CHCl_3}$)
- **Methanol** ($\ce{CH_3OH}$)
- **Hydrochloric acid** ($\ce{HCl}$)

## Summary

- **From Ethanol**: Trichloromethane is produced by **chlorination** of ethanol, leading to the formation of chloroform, hydrochloric acid, and water.
- **From Propanone**: Chlorination of propanone results in the formation of chloroform, along with methanol and hydrochloric acid.

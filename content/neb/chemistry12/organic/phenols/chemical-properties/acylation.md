# Acylation Reaction, Kolbe's Reaction, Reimer-Tiemann's Reaction

Phenol and other aromatic compounds undergo several important reactions that lead to the introduction of functional groups, such as acyl groups or halogens. Among these, the acylation reaction, Kolbe's reaction, and Reimer-Tiemann's reaction are widely used in organic synthesis.

### 1. **Acylation Reaction**
The acylation reaction of phenol involves the substitution of a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring by an acyl group ($\ce{RCO-}$). This reaction typically occurs in the presence of a catalyst such as aluminum chloride ($\ce{AlCl_3}$) and results in the formation of an aryl ester.

The general reaction is:
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + RCOCl \xrightarrow{AlCl_3} C_6H_5COOR}$$

In this reaction, phenol reacts with an acyl chloride ($\ce{RCOCl}$) to form the corresponding aryl ester, phenyl acetate, for example, if $\ce{RCOCl}$ is acetyl chloride.

### 2. **Kolbe's Reaction**
Kolbe's reaction involves the reaction of phenol with sodium hydroxide ($\ce{NaOH}$) and carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO_2}$) under high pressure, forming a hydroxybenzoic acid. This reaction is an example of the introduction of a carboxyl group (-COOH) to the aromatic ring.

The general reaction is:
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + NaOH + CO_2 \xrightarrow{high pressure} C_6H_4(OH)(COOH)}$$

In this reaction, phenol reacts with sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide to form salicylic acid, which is used in the preparation of aspirin and other pharmaceuticals.

### 3. **Reimer-Tiemann's Reaction**
The Reimer-Tiemann reaction is a method for the formylation of phenols to produce ortho- and para-hydroxybenzaldehydes. In this reaction, phenol reacts with chloroform ($\ce{CHCl_3}$) in the presence of a strong base like sodium hydroxide ($\ce{NaOH}$) to introduce a formyl group (-CHO) into the aromatic ring.

The general reaction is:
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + CHCl_3 + NaOH \rightarrow C_6H_4(OH)(CHO) + NaCl + H_2O}$$

This reaction leads to the formation of salicylaldehyde, which has applications in the synthesis of various aromatic compounds and pharmaceuticals.

# Physical Properties of Phenol

Phenol, $\ce{C6H5OH}$, exhibits unique physical properties due to the presence of a hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic ring. Below are the key physical properties of phenol:

### 1. Appearance
Phenol is a colorless crystalline solid under normal conditions. However, it may appear pink due to oxidation on exposure to air and light.

### 2. Melting and Boiling Points
- **Melting Point**: Phenol has a melting point of **41°C**, which is relatively high for a compound of its size due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
- **Boiling Point**: Its boiling point is **182°C**, which is significantly higher than that of benzene because of the presence of the hydroxyl group.

### 3. Solubility
Phenol is moderately soluble in water due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of phenol and water molecules. Its solubility decreases as the size of the alkyl group increases in substituted phenols.

### 4. Odor
Phenol has a characteristic "medicinal" or phenolic odor.

### 5. Density
Phenol has a density of **1.07 g/cm³** at room temperature, making it slightly denser than water.

### 6. Acidity
Phenol is weakly acidic, with a pKa of approximately 9.95. This acidity is attributed to the ability of the phenoxide ion ($\ce{C6H5O^-}$) to delocalize charge over the aromatic ring.

### 7. Miscellaneous Properties
- Phenol is corrosive and can cause burns on skin contact.
- It is hygroscopic and absorbs moisture from the air.

## Summary

Phenol is a colorless, crystalline compound with a distinct medicinal odor. It has a relatively high melting point (41°C) and boiling point (182°C) due to hydrogen bonding. Phenol is moderately soluble in water and weakly acidic. It is slightly denser than water, corrosive, and hygroscopic.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the physical state of pure phenol at room temperature?
Phenol is a crystalline solid at room temperature.

### 2. Why does phenol have a higher boiling point than benzene?
Phenol has a higher boiling point than benzene due to the presence of hydrogen bonding between its molecules.

### 3. Is phenol soluble in water?
Yes, phenol is moderately soluble in water due to hydrogen bonding.

### 4. What is the odor of phenol?
Phenol has a characteristic medicinal or phenolic odor.

### 5. What is the density of phenol?
The density of phenol is approximately **1.07 g/cm³** at room temperature.

### 6. Why is phenol weakly acidic?
Phenol is weakly acidic because the phenoxide ion ($\ce{C6H5O^-}$) formed upon deprotonation is stabilized by resonance.

### 7. What happens to phenol on exposure to air?
Phenol may turn pink upon exposure to air and light due to oxidation.

### 8. What is the melting point of phenol?
The melting point of phenol is **41°C**.

### 9. Is phenol corrosive?
Yes, phenol is corrosive and can cause burns on skin contact.

### 10. How does the hydroxyl group in phenol affect its solubility?
The hydroxyl group allows phenol to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, making it moderately soluble in water.

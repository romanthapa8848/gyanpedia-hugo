# Preparation of Phenol from Chlorobenzene, Diazonium Salt, and Benzene Sulphonic Acid

Phenol can be synthesized through various methods, including starting from chlorobenzene, diazonium salts, and benzene sulphonic acid. These methods involve specific chemical reactions under controlled conditions.

### 1. Preparation of Phenol from Chlorobenzene
Chlorobenzene is treated with sodium hydroxide under high temperature and pressure to form phenol:
$$
\ce{C6H5Cl + NaOH ->[573K, 300 atm] C6H5ONa + HCl}
$$
The resulting sodium phenoxide is then acidified to yield phenol:
$$
\ce{C6H5ONa + HCl -> C6H5OH + NaCl}
$$

### 2. Preparation of Phenol from Diazonium Salt
Phenol can be prepared by hydrolysis of benzene diazonium salt. The diazonium salt is treated with warm water to produce phenol along with the release of nitrogen gas:
$$
\ce{C6H5N2+Cl- + H2O -> C6H5OH + N2 + HCl}
$$

### 3. Preparation of Phenol from Benzene Sulphonic Acid
Benzene sulphonic acid is fused with sodium hydroxide at high temperature to form sodium phenoxide, which is then acidified to produce phenol:
$$
\ce{C6H5SO3H + NaOH ->[Heat] C6H5ONa + Na2SO3}
$$
$$
\ce{C6H5ONa + HCl -> C6H5OH + NaCl}
$$

## FAQs

### 1. What is the starting material in phenol preparation from chlorobenzene?
Chlorobenzene is the starting material.

### 2. What are the conditions required for converting chlorobenzene to phenol?
High temperature (573 K) and high pressure (300 atm) with sodium hydroxide are required.

### 3. What is benzene diazonium salt?
It is an organic compound with the formula $\ce{C6H5N2+Cl-}$, formed by treating aniline with nitrous acid.

### 4. What is the byproduct of phenol synthesis from diazonium salt?
Nitrogen gas ($\ce{N2}$) and hydrochloric acid ($\ce{HCl}$) are the byproducts.

### 5. How is phenol obtained from benzene sulphonic acid?
By fusing benzene sulphonic acid with sodium hydroxide, followed by acidification.

### 6. What is sodium phenoxide?
Sodium phenoxide ($\ce{C6H5ONa}$) is an intermediate compound formed during phenol preparation.

### 7. Why is high pressure required in the preparation of phenol from chlorobenzene?
High pressure helps in overcoming the stability of the $\ce{C-Cl}$ bond in chlorobenzene.

### 8. What is the role of acid in phenol preparation?
Acid neutralizes the phenoxide ion to yield phenol.

### 9. Can diazonium salt be directly converted to phenol?
Yes, by hydrolysis with warm water.

### 10. What are the main byproducts in these methods?
The byproducts include sodium chloride ($\ce{NaCl}$), sodium sulphite ($\ce{Na2SO3}$), nitrogen gas ($\ce{N2}$), and hydrochloric acid ($\ce{HCl}$).

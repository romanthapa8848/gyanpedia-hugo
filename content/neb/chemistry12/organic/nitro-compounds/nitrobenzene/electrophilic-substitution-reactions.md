# Nitrobenzene: Electrophilic Substitution Reactions (Nitration, Sulphonation & Bromination)

Electrophilic substitution reactions are a class of reactions in which an electrophile replaces a hydrogen atom on an aromatic ring. Nitrobenzene, due to the presence of the electron-withdrawing $\ce{-NO2}$ group, exhibits a lower reactivity towards electrophilic substitution compared to benzene. These reactions proceed, but the nitro group directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position. In this section, we discuss three important electrophilic substitution reactions of nitrobenzene: nitration, sulphonation, and bromination.

## 1. Nitration of Nitrobenzene

Nitration is the substitution of a hydrogen atom with a nitro group ($\ce{NO2}$). The reaction is typically carried out with a nitrating mixture, which is a mixture of concentrated nitric acid ($\ce{HNO3}$) and concentrated sulfuric acid ($\ce{H2SO4}$). The $\ce{-NO2}$ group is electron-withdrawing, which makes the aromatic ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. As a result, the nitro group directs the incoming nitronium ion ($\ce{NO2+}$) to the meta position.

### Reaction:

$$
\ce{C6H5NO2 + HNO3 -> C6H4(NO2)2 + H2O}
$$

This typically results in the formation of **1,3-dinitrobenzene**.

## 2. Sulphonation of Nitrobenzene

In sulphonation, a hydrogen atom is substituted by a sulfonic acid group ($\ce{-SO3H}$). The reaction is carried out in the presence of fuming sulfuric acid ($\ce{H2SO4}$), which provides the $\ce{SO3}$ electrophile. Due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the $\ce{NO2}$ group, the substitution occurs at the meta position, yielding 1,3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.

### Reaction:

$$
\ce{C6H5NO2 + SO3 -> C6H4(NO2)SO3H}
$$

## 3. Bromination of Nitrobenzene

Bromination of nitrobenzene involves the substitution of a hydrogen atom with a bromine atom ($\ce{Br}$). This reaction is usually carried out in the presence of bromine ($\ce{Br2}$) and a Lewis acid catalyst, such as iron (III) bromide ($\ce{FeBr3}$). The electron-withdrawing $\ce{NO2}$ group deactivates the ring, making it less reactive towards electrophiles. As with nitration and sulphonation, bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position.

### Reaction:

$$
\ce{C6H5NO2 + Br2 -> C6H4(NO2)Br + HBr}
$$

This reaction typically forms **1,3-bromonitrobenzene**.

## Summary

- **Nitration**: Nitrobenzene undergoes nitration to form 1,3-dinitrobenzene with $\ce{NO2+}$ as the electrophile.
- **Sulphonation**: Nitrobenzene reacts with $\ce{SO3}$ to yield 1,3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.
- **Bromination**: Bromine reacts with nitrobenzene in the presence of $\ce{FeBr3}$ to form 1,3-bromonitrobenzene.

In all these reactions, the nitro group ($\ce{-NO2}$) directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

## FAQs

### 1. Why does nitrobenzene undergo electrophilic substitution at the meta position?

The $\ce{-NO2}$ group is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution and directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position.

### 2. What is the role of $\ce{H2SO4}$ in sulphonation of nitrobenzene?

$\ce{H2SO4}$ acts as a catalyst and also provides the $\ce{SO3}$ electrophile in the sulphonation reaction.

### 3. What is the product of nitration of nitrobenzene?

The product of nitration of nitrobenzene is typically **1,3-dinitrobenzene**.

### 4. Which electrophile is used in the bromination of nitrobenzene?

In the bromination of nitrobenzene, the electrophile is the bromonium ion ($\ce{Br+}$), generated in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst like $\ce{FeBr3}$.

### 5. How does the $\ce{-NO2}$ group affect the reactivity of nitrobenzene?

The $\ce{-NO2}$ group is electron-withdrawing, which deactivates the benzene ring and makes it less reactive towards electrophilic substitution reactions.

### 6. What is the product of sulphonation of nitrobenzene?

The product of sulphonation of nitrobenzene is **1,3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.

### 7. Does nitrobenzene undergo electrophilic substitution more readily than benzene?

No, nitrobenzene is less reactive towards electrophilic substitution than benzene due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the $\ce{-NO2}$ group.

### 8. How does the presence of $\ce{FeBr3}$ affect the bromination of nitrobenzene?

$\ce{FeBr3}$ acts as a catalyst and helps in generating the electrophilic $\ce{Br+}$ ion, which then reacts with nitrobenzene.

### 9. Can the nitration of nitrobenzene result in ortho substitution?

No, due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the $\ce{-NO2}$ group, nitration occurs predominantly at the meta position, not the ortho position.

### 10. What is the general trend for the position of substitution in nitrobenzene?

The $\ce{-NO2}$ group directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position due to its electron-withdrawing effect.

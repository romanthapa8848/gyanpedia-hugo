# Preparation of Chlorobenzene from Benzene and Benzene Diazonium Chloride

Chlorobenzene is an aromatic compound in which a chlorine atom is attached to a benzene ring. One of the methods for preparing chlorobenzene involves an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction between benzene and benzene diazonium chloride.

## Preparation Steps

1. **Formation of Benzene Diazonium Chloride:**
   - First, **aniline ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2$)** reacts with **nitrous acid ($\text{HNO}_2$)** under acidic conditions to form **benzene diazonium chloride ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{N}_2^+\text{Cl}^-$)**.
   - The reaction proceeds as follows:
   $$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2 + \text{HNO}_2 + \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{N}_2^+\text{Cl}^- + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} $$

2. **Electrophilic Substitution with Chlorine:**
   - The benzene diazonium chloride reacts with **copper(I) chloride ($\text{CuCl}$)** to substitute the diazonium group with a chlorine atom, forming **chlorobenzene ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{Cl}$)**.
   - The reaction proceeds as follows:
   $$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{N}_2^+\text{Cl}^- + \text{CuCl} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{Cl} + \text{CuCl}_2 $$

### Reaction Mechanism:
- The **benzene diazonium ion** acts as an electrophile, attacking the **benzene ring** in a substitution reaction.
- The copper(I) chloride ($\text{CuCl}$) facilitates the substitution of the diazonium ion with a chlorine atom.

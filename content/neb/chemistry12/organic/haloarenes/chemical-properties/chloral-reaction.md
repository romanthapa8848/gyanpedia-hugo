# Action with Chloral

Chloral (CCl₃CHO) is an important reagent in organic chemistry, particularly in reactions involving **haloarenes**. It is a highly reactive electrophile and can participate in various substitution reactions. One of the notable reactions involving chloral is its reaction with haloarenes, which leads to the formation of chloral derivatives.

## 1. **Chloral Addition Reaction to Haloarenes**

In this reaction, haloarenes, especially those with an electron-donating group on the aromatic ring, can undergo addition reactions with chloral. The halogen on the haloarene is replaced by the chloral group, leading to the formation of chloral derivatives of aromatic compounds.

### Mechanism:
1. **Electrophilic Attack**: Chloral, being an electrophilic species due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group, attacks the electron-rich aromatic ring of the haloarene.
2. **Substitution**: The halogen atom is displaced by the chloral group, forming a **chloroalphenyl derivative**.

### Example:
$$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{Cl} + \text{CCl}_3\text{CHO} \xrightarrow{\text{heat}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_4(\text{Cl})\text{CCl}_3\text{CHO} $$

Here, **chlorobenzene** reacts with chloral to form a **chloral-substituted phenyl compound**.

## 2. **Chloral Condensation Reactions**

Chloral can also undergo condensation reactions with **aromatic aldehydes** or **ketones** under specific conditions, leading to the formation of **chloral condensation products**. These reactions are useful in the synthesis of various chloral derivatives.

### Mechanism:
1. **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic species (such as an aromatic aldehyde or ketone) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of chloral.
2. **Condensation**: The reaction leads to the formation of a **new C-C bond** between the chloral and the aromatic compound.

### Example:
$$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{CHO} + \text{CCl}_3\text{CHO} \xrightarrow{\text{condensation}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_4(\text{CHO})\text{CCl}_3\text{CHO} $$

In this case, **benzaldehyde** reacts with chloral to form a chloral condensation product.

## Summary

The reaction of **chloral** with **haloarenes** typically involves electrophilic substitution or condensation mechanisms. The resulting products are often chloral derivatives, which are valuable intermediates in the synthesis of various aromatic compounds.

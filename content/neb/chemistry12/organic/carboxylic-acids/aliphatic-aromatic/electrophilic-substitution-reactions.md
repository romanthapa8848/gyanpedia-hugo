# Electrophilic Substitution Reaction of Benzoic Acid - Bromination, Nitration, and Sulphonation

Benzoic acid undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions, where electrophiles are introduced to the benzene ring, typically at the **meta** position relative to the carboxyl group (-COOH) due to its electron-withdrawing nature. These reactions are important for modifying the structure of benzoic acid, leading to the formation of useful derivatives.

## Bromination of Benzoic Acid

In the bromination reaction, bromine ($\ce{Br_2}$) is used as the electrophile. The presence of a catalyst like iron (Fe) or iron(III) bromide ($\ce{FeBr_3}$) is necessary to generate the bromonium ion, which reacts with the benzene ring.

- **Reaction**:
  $$ 
  \ce{C_6H_5COOH + Br_2 \xrightarrow{FeBr_3} o-\ce{C_6H_4(CO2H)(Br)} \text{ (meta product)}}
  $$

Here, the bromine is substituted at the **meta** position relative to the carboxyl group.

## Nitration of Benzoic Acid

Nitration involves the electrophilic attack of the nitronium ion ($\ce{NO_2^+}$) on the benzene ring. The nitration mixture consists of concentrated nitric acid ($\ce{HNO_3}$) and concentrated sulfuric acid ($\ce{H_2SO_4}$). The carboxyl group (-COOH) deactivates the benzene ring and directs the incoming electrophile to the **meta** position.

- **Reaction**:
  $$ 
  \ce{C_6H_5COOH + HNO_3 \xrightarrow{H_2SO_4} m-\ce{C_6H_4(CO2H)(NO2)}}
  $$

Here, the nitro group ($\ce{NO_2}$) is substituted at the **meta** position.

## Sulphonation of Benzoic Acid

In the sulphonation reaction, the electrophile is the sulfonium ion ($\ce{SO_3^+}$), which is generated by the reaction of sulfur trioxide ($\ce{SO_3}$) with a strong acid like sulfuric acid ($\ce{H_2SO_4}$). The carboxyl group (-COOH) directs the electrophilic attack to the **meta** position of the benzene ring.

- **Reaction**:
  $$ 
  \ce{C_6H_5COOH + SO_3 \xrightarrow{H_2SO_4} m-\ce{C_6H_4(CO2H)(SO3H)}}
  $$

Here, the sulfonic acid group ($\ce{SO_3H}$) is introduced at the **meta** position.

## Summary

In electrophilic substitution reactions of benzoic acid, the carboxyl group (-COOH) deactivates the aromatic ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the **meta** position. The main reactions include:

1. **Bromination** with $\ce{Br_2}$ (using $\ce{FeBr_3}$ as a catalyst),
2. **Nitration** with a mixture of $\ce{HNO_3}$ and $\ce{H_2SO_4}$,
3. **Sulphonation** with $\ce{SO_3}$ in the presence of $\ce{H_2SO_4}$.

These reactions yield meta-substituted products due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carboxyl group.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the product of the bromination of benzoic acid?

The product is **meta-bromobenzoic acid**, with the bromine atom introduced at the meta position relative to the carboxyl group.

### 2. Why does the carboxyl group direct electrophiles to the meta position?

The carboxyl group is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the benzene ring and makes the meta position more reactive towards electrophilic attack.

### 3. What is used as the electrophile in the nitration of benzoic acid?

The electrophile in nitration is the **nitronium ion ($\ce{NO_2^+}$)**, generated from the reaction of nitric acid and sulfuric acid.

### 4. Why is sulfuric acid used in the sulphonation of benzoic acid?

Sulfuric acid is used as both a catalyst and a source of the sulfonium ion ($\ce{SO_3^+}$), which acts as the electrophile in the sulphonation reaction.

### 5. What is the effect of the carboxyl group on the reactivity of benzoic acid?

The carboxyl group is an electron-withdrawing group, which decreases the electron density on the benzene ring, making it less reactive and directing electrophiles to the meta position.

### 6. What type of catalyst is used in the bromination of benzoic acid?

The catalyst used in the bromination of benzoic acid is **iron(III) bromide ($\ce{FeBr_3}$)**, which helps generate the electrophilic bromine species.

### 7. What is the role of sulfuric acid in nitration?

Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst in nitration by generating the nitronium ion ($\ce{NO_2^+}$) from nitric acid.

### 8. What is the main product of the nitration of benzoic acid?

The main product of nitration is **meta-nitrobenzoic acid**, where the nitro group is added at the meta position relative to the carboxyl group.

### 9. What does the sulphonation of benzoic acid produce?

The sulphonation of benzoic acid produces **meta-sulphobenzoic acid**, where the sulfonic acid group ($\ce{SO_3H}$) is introduced at the meta position.

### 10. Can benzoic acid undergo electrophilic substitution at positions other than the meta position?

No, due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carboxyl group, electrophilic substitution predominantly occurs at the meta position, not at the ortho or para positions.

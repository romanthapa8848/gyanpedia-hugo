# Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky Reaction

The Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction involves the halogenation of carboxylic acids, where a halogen (usually bromine) is introduced at the $\alpha$-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). This reaction typically proceeds through the formation of an acyl bromide intermediate and is catalyzed by a halogen, such as bromine, and a catalyst like phosphorus tribromide (PBr₃).

## Mechanism of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky Reaction

1. **Formation of Acyl Bromide**: The carboxylic acid reacts with phosphorus tribromide ($\ce{PBr_3}$), forming an acyl bromide intermediate.

   $$
   \ce{RCOOH + PBr_3 \rightarrow RCOBr + HBr}
   $$

2. **Halogenation of the $\alpha$-Carbon**: The acyl bromide reacts with bromine ($\ce{Br_2}$) in the presence of a base, usually a small amount of bromine, to introduce a bromine atom at the $\alpha$-position.

   $$
   \ce{RCOBr + Br_2 \xrightarrow{Base} R\alpha C(Br)OBr}
   $$

The reaction generally gives $\alpha$-halo carboxylic acids or their derivatives.

## Example

**Acetic Acid Halogenation**:

When **acetic acid** reacts with bromine in the presence of phosphorus tribromide, **bromoacetic acid** is formed:

$$
\ce{CH_3COOH + PBr_3 \rightarrow CH_3COBr + HBr}
$$
$$
\ce{CH_3COBr + Br_2 \xrightarrow{Base} CH_2BrCOOH}
$$

## Summary

The Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction is a method for halogenating carboxylic acids at the $\alpha$-position. The reaction uses **PBr₃** to convert the carboxylic acid to an acyl bromide, followed by halogenation with bromine. This reaction is particularly useful in the preparation of $\alpha$-halo acids.

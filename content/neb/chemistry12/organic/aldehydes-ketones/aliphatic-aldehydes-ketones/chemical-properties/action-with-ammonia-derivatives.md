# Action of Aldehyde and Ketone with Ammonia Derivatives: NH₂OH, NH₂-NH₂, Phenyl Hydrazine, Semicarbazide

Aldehydes and ketones, due to their reactive carbonyl group ($\ce{C=O}$), undergo nucleophilic addition reactions with various ammonia derivatives such as hydroxylamine (NH₂OH), hydrazine (NH₂-NH₂), phenyl hydrazine, and semicarbazide. These reactions lead to the formation of various compounds such as oximes, hydrazones, phenyl hydrazones, and semicarbazones.

## 1. Reaction with Hydroxylamine (NH₂OH)

When aldehydes and ketones react with hydroxylamine, they form **oximes**. This reaction involves the addition of hydroxylamine ($\ce{NH_2OH}$) to the carbonyl group.

- **Reaction with Aldehydes:**

$$
\ce{RCHO + NH_2OH \rightarrow RCH=NOH}
$$

- **Reaction with Ketones:**

$$
\ce{R_2CO + NH_2OH \rightarrow R_2C=NOH}
$$

The product is called an **oxime**, where the $\ce{C=N-OH}$ group is formed.

## 2. Reaction with Hydrazine (NH₂-NH₂)

Hydrazine reacts with aldehydes and ketones to form **hydrazones**. This is a nucleophilic addition-elimination reaction, and it leads to the formation of a $\ce{C=N-NH_2}$ linkage.

- **Reaction with Aldehydes:**

$$
\ce{RCHO + NH_2NH_2 \rightarrow RCH=N-NH_2}
$$

- **Reaction with Ketones:**

$$
\ce{R_2CO + NH_2NH_2 \rightarrow R_2C=N-NH_2}
$$

The product of this reaction is a **hydrazone**.

## 3. Reaction with Phenyl Hydrazine

Phenyl hydrazine ($\ce{C_6H_5NH-NH_2}$) also reacts with aldehydes and ketones to form **phenylhydrazones**. This reaction is similar to the reaction with hydrazine, where the $\ce{C=N-NH_2}$ linkage is formed, but here the hydrazine group is substituted by a phenyl group ($\ce{C_6H_5}$).

- **Reaction with Aldehydes:**

$$
\ce{RCHO + C_6H_5NH-NH_2 \rightarrow RCH=N-NH-C_6H_5}
$$

- **Reaction with Ketones:**

$$
\ce{R_2CO + C_6H_5NH-NH_2 \rightarrow R_2C=N-NH-C_6H_5}
$$

The product formed is a **phenylhydrazone**.

## 4. Reaction with Semicarbazide

When aldehydes and ketones react with semicarbazide ($\ce{NH_2CONH_2}$), they form **semicarbazones**. This reaction is similar to the hydrazone formation but uses semicarbazide as the nucleophile.

- **Reaction with Aldehydes:**

$$
\ce{RCHO + NH_2CONH_2 \rightarrow RCH=N-NH-CONH_2}
$$

- **Reaction with Ketones:**

$$
\ce{R_2CO + NH_2CONH_2 \rightarrow R_2C=N-NH-CONH_2}
$$

The product formed is a **semicarbazone**.

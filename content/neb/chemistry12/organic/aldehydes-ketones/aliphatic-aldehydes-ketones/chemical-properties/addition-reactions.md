# Addition Reactions: Addition of H₂, HCN, and NaHSO₃

Addition reactions are a key characteristic of aldehydes and ketones due to the presence of the polar carbonyl group ($\ce{C=O}$). The addition of various reagents like hydrogen (H₂), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and sodium bisulfite (NaHSO₃) to the carbonyl group leads to different products.

## 1. Addition of Hydrogen (H₂) – Reduction

- **Reaction with Aldehydes:**  
  Aldehydes are reduced to primary alcohols upon addition of hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst (like palladium, platinum, or nickel):

$$
\ce{RCHO + H_2 \xrightarrow{Ni} RCH_2OH}
$$

- **Reaction with Ketones:**  
  Ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols upon addition of hydrogen:

$$
\ce{R_2CO + H_2 \xrightarrow{Ni} R_2CHOH}
$$

This reaction is commonly known as catalytic hydrogenation.

## 2. Addition of Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN)

- **Reaction with Aldehydes:**  
  Aldehydes react with hydrogen cyanide to form cyanohydrins. The reaction adds a hydroxyl group and a cyanide group to the carbonyl carbon:

$$
\ce{RCHO + HCN \rightarrow RCH(OH)CN}
$$

- **Reaction with Ketones:**  
  Similarly, ketones react with hydrogen cyanide to form cyanohydrins:

$$
\ce{R_2CO + HCN \rightarrow R_2C(OH)CN}
$$

The cyanohydrin formed has both a hydroxyl group ($\ce{-OH}$) and a nitrile group ($\ce{-CN}$).

## 3. Addition of Sodium Bisulfite (NaHSO₃)

- **Reaction with Aldehydes and Ketones:**  
  Both aldehydes and ketones react with sodium bisulfite to form an adduct. The reaction involves the addition of bisulfite ($\ce{HSO_3^-}$) to the carbonyl group, forming an intermediate adduct:

$$
\ce{RCHO + NaHSO_3 \rightarrow RCH(OH)SO_3Na} \quad (\text{for aldehydes})
$$

$$
\ce{R_2CO + NaHSO_3 \rightarrow R_2C(OH)SO_3Na} \quad (\text{for ketones})
$$

This reaction is useful for the purification of aldehydes and ketones, as the adduct can often be crystallized and separated.

# Aldol Condensation

Aldol condensation is a reaction in which aldehydes or ketones, containing an $\alpha$-hydrogen, undergo nucleophilic attack by an enolate ion to form $\alpha, \beta$-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. This reaction involves the initial formation of an aldol addition product, which subsequently undergoes dehydration to yield the final product.

## Mechanism of Aldol Condensation

1. **Formation of Enolate Ion:**
   The base abstracts an $\alpha$-hydrogen from an aldehyde or ketone to form an enolate ion.

$$
\ce{R-CHO + OH^- \rightarrow R-C(=O)^{\ominus}-CH_2}
$$

2. **Nucleophilic Attack:**
   The enolate ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of aldehyde or ketone, forming the aldol addition product.

$$
\ce{R-C(=O)^{\ominus}-CH_2 + R-CHO \rightarrow R-CH(OH)-CH_2-C(=O)R}
$$

3. **Dehydration:**
   The aldol addition product undergoes elimination of a water molecule to form an $\alpha, \beta$-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

$$
\ce{R-CH(OH)-CH_2-C(=O)R \xrightarrow{heat} R-CH=CH-C(=O)R + H_2O}
$$

## Example: Aldol Condensation of Acetaldehyde

When acetaldehyde ($\ce{CH_3CHO}$) undergoes aldol condensation, it forms $\alpha, \beta$-unsaturated aldehyde, crotonaldehyde.

1. **Formation of enolate ion:**

$$
\ce{CH_3CHO + OH^- \rightarrow CH_3C(=O)^{\ominus}-CH_2}
$$

2. **Nucleophilic attack:**

$$
\ce{CH_3C(=O)^{\ominus}-CH_2 + CH_3CHO \rightarrow CH_3CH(OH)CH_2C(=O)CH_3}
$$

3. **Dehydration to form crotonaldehyde:**

$$
\ce{CH_3CH(OH)CH_2C(=O)CH_3 \xrightarrow{heat} CH_3CH=CHC(=O)CH_3 + H_2O}
$$

# Chemical Properties: Aliphatic Aldehydes and Ketones

Aliphatic aldehydes and ketones exhibit a variety of chemical properties due to the presence of the carbonyl group ($\ce{C=O}$). These properties are important in understanding the reactivity of these compounds in different reactions.

---

## 1. Oxidation

- **Aldehydes** are easily oxidized to carboxylic acids, whereas **ketones** are resistant to oxidation. The carbonyl group in aldehydes is more susceptible to oxidation due to the presence of a hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon.

**Oxidation of Aldehyde:**
$$
\ce{RCHO + [O] -> RCOOH}
$$
In this reaction, aldehyde ($\ce{RCHO}$) is oxidized to carboxylic acid ($\ce{RCOOH}$).

**Oxidation of Ketone:**  
Ketones require harsher conditions for oxidation, and typically they do not oxidize under normal conditions.

---

## 2. Reduction

Both aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to alcohols. 

**Reduction of Aldehyde:**
$$
\ce{RCHO + 2[H] -> RCH2OH}
$$
In this reaction, the aldehyde ($\ce{RCHO}$) is reduced to a primary alcohol ($\ce{RCH2OH}$).

**Reduction of Ketone:**
$$
\ce{RCOR' + 2[H] -> RCH(OH)R'}
$$
Here, the ketone ($\ce{RCOR'}$) is reduced to a secondary alcohol ($\ce{RCH(OH)R'}$).

---

## 3. Nucleophilic Addition Reactions

Aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions due to the electrophilic nature of the carbonyl carbon.

### a. Addition of Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN)

Aldehydes and ketones react with hydrogen cyanide ($\ce{HCN}$) to form cyanohydrins.

**Addition of HCN to Aldehyde:**
$$
\ce{RCHO + HCN -> RCH(OH)CN}
$$

**Addition of HCN to Ketone:**
$$
\ce{RCOR' + HCN -> RCH(OH)CNR'}
$$

---

## 4. Condensation Reactions

Aldehydes and ketones also undergo condensation reactions, where two molecules combine to form a larger product, usually with the loss of a small molecule like water.

### a. Aldol Condensation

This reaction occurs when two molecules of aldehydes or ketones react in the presence of a base to form $\beta$-hydroxy aldehydes or ketones, which may further undergo dehydration to form $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.

**Aldol Addition:**
$$
\ce{RCHO + RCHO (Base) -> RCH(OH)CH(OH)R}
$$

**Aldol Condensation:**
$$
\ce{RCH(OH)CH(OH)R -> RCH=CH(R) + H2O}
$$

---

## 5. Formation of Imine and Enamine

Aldehydes and ketones react with primary amines ($\ce{RNH2}$) to form imines (Schiff bases) and with secondary amines to form enamines.

**Formation of Imines (Schiff Base):**
$$
\ce{RCHO + RNH2 -> RCH=NH + H2O}
$$

**Formation of Enamines:**
$$
\ce{RCOR' + R2NH -> RC(NHR')=CH2 + H2O}
$$

---

## 6. Reactions with Grignard Reagents

Aldehydes and ketones react with Grignard reagents ($\ce{RMgX}$) to form alcohols.

**Reaction with Aldehyde:**
$$
\ce{RCHO + RMgX -> RCH(OMgX)R' -> RCH(OH)R' (upon hydrolysis)}
$$

**Reaction with Ketone:**
$$
\ce{RCOR' + RMgX -> RCH(OMgX)R'R'' -> RCH(OH)R'R'' (upon hydrolysis)}
$$

## Summary

- **Oxidation:** Aldehydes are easily oxidized to carboxylic acids, while ketones resist oxidation.
- **Reduction:** Both aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to alcohols.
- **Nucleophilic Addition:** Aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition with reagents like HCN.
- **Condensation:** Aldehydes and ketones undergo aldol condensation, leading to the formation of $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.
- **Formation of Imines/Enamines:** Aldehydes and ketones react with amines to form imines and enamines.
- **Grignard Reagents:** Both react with Grignard reagents to form alcohols.

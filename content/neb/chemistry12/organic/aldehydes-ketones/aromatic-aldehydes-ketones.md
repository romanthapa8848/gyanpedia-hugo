# Aromatic Aldehydes and Ketones

Aromatic aldehydes and ketones are organic compounds in which the carbonyl group ($\ce{C=O}$) is attached to an aromatic ring. In aldehydes, the carbonyl group is attached to at least one hydrogen atom, while in ketones, it is bonded to two carbon atoms. The presence of the aromatic ring imparts special properties to these compounds, such as increased stability and distinct reactivity patterns. They are important intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, perfumes, dyes, and various other industrial chemicals.

## Structure of Aromatic Aldehydes and Ketones

- **Aromatic Aldehydes**: The general structure of aromatic aldehydes is represented as $\ce{Ar-CHO}$, where $\ce{Ar}$ represents an aromatic ring, and $\ce{CHO}$ represents the aldehyde group.
  
  Example: **Benzaldehyde** ($\ce{C_6H_5CHO}$)

- **Aromatic Ketones**: The general structure of aromatic ketones is represented as $\ce{Ar-CO-R}$, where $\ce{Ar}$ is the aromatic ring, $\ce{CO}$ is the carbonyl group, and $\ce{R}$ is an alkyl or aryl group.

  Example: **Acetophenone** ($\ce{C_6H_5COCH_3}$)

# Properties of Benzaldehyde: Cannizzaro's Reaction

Benzaldehyde ($\ce{C_6H_5CHO}$) is an aromatic aldehyde that, when treated with a strong base, undergoes the Cannizzaro reaction. This reaction is a redox disproportionation in which one molecule of benzaldehyde is reduced to benzyl alcohol ($\ce{C_6H_5CH_2OH}$), while the other molecule is oxidized to form sodium benzoate ($\ce{C_6H_5COONa}$).

## Mechanism of Cannizzaro's Reaction with Benzaldehyde

In the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydroxide ($\ce{NaOH}$), the Cannizzaro reaction occurs as follows:

1. **Deprotonation of Benzaldehyde:** The base deprotonates the aldehyde to form the alkoxide ion ($\ce{C_6H_5CH_2O^-}$).
2. **Disproportionation:** The alkoxide ion donates a hydride ion ($\ce{H^-}$) to another molecule of benzaldehyde. One molecule is reduced to benzyl alcohol, and the other is oxidized to the carboxylate ion ($\ce{C_6H_5COO^-}$).
3. **Formation of Products:** The products of the reaction are benzyl alcohol ($\ce{C_6H_5CH_2OH}$) and sodium benzoate ($\ce{C_6H_5COONa}$).

### General Reaction:

$$ \ce{2C_6H_5CHO + NaOH \rightarrow C_6H_5CH_2OH + C_6H_5COONa} $$

This reaction is a classic example of the Cannizzaro reaction in aromatic aldehydes.

## Example with Benzaldehyde

When benzaldehyde is treated with sodium hydroxide, the reaction can be represented as:

$$ \ce{2C_6H_5CHO + NaOH \rightarrow C_6H_5CH_2OH + C_6H_5COONa} $$

Here, one molecule of benzaldehyde is reduced to benzyl alcohol, while the other is oxidized to sodium benzoate.

## Properties of Benzaldehyde in the Cannizzaro Reaction

- **Physical State:** Benzaldehyde is a colorless or pale yellow liquid with a characteristic almond-like odor.
- **Solubility:** It is slightly soluble in water but highly soluble in organic solvents such as alcohol and ether.
- **Reaction with Strong Bases:** When exposed to strong bases like sodium hydroxide, benzaldehyde undergoes the Cannizzaro reaction, resulting in the formation of benzyl alcohol and sodium benzoate.

## Summary

Benzaldehyde, when treated with a strong base like $\ce{NaOH}$, undergoes the Cannizzaro reaction, a disproportionation process where one molecule is reduced to an alcohol (benzyl alcohol) and the other is oxidized to a carboxylate salt (sodium benzoate). This reaction highlights the unique behavior of benzaldehyde in the presence of strong bases.

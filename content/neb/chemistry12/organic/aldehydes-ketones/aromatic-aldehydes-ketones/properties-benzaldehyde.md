## Physical Properties

1. **Appearance**: Benzaldehyde is a colorless liquid in its pure form.
2. **Boiling Point**: It has a boiling point of $179^\circ C$.
3. **Melting Point**: The melting point is $-26^\circ C$.
4. **Solubility**: Benzaldehyde is slightly soluble in water but readily soluble in organic solvents like ethanol, ether, and chloroform.
5. **Odor**: It has a characteristic pleasant almond-like smell.
6. **Density**: The density of benzaldehyde is $1.04\ \text{g/cm}^3$ at $20^\circ C$.

## Chemical Properties

1. **Oxidation**: Benzaldehyde can be oxidized to benzoic acid ($\ce{C_6H_5COOH}$) under strong oxidative conditions.
   $$ \ce{C_6H_5CHO + [O] -> C_6H_5COOH} $$

2. **Reduction**: Benzaldehyde can be reduced to the corresponding primary alcohol, benzyl alcohol ($\ce{C_6H_5CH_2OH}$), by reducing agents like sodium borohydride ($\ce{NaBH_4}$).
   $$ \ce{C_6H_5CHO + NaBH_4 -> C_6H_5CH_2OH} $$

3. **Reaction with Alcohols**: Benzaldehyde reacts with alcohols in the presence of an acid catalyst to form acetals, a typical reaction for aldehydes.
   $$ \ce{C_6H_5CHO + ROH -> C_6H_5CH(OR)O} $$

4. **Nucleophilic Addition**: The carbonyl group in benzaldehyde is reactive towards nucleophiles such as cyanide ions, resulting in the formation of a cyanohydrin.
   $$ \ce{C_6H_5CHO + HCN -> C_6H_5CH(OH)CN} $$

5. **Aldol Condensation**: Benzaldehyde undergoes aldol condensation when reacted with an active methylene group under basic conditions.
   $$ \ce{C_6H_5CHO + CH_2=CH_2 -> C_6H_5CH(OH)CH_2CHO} $$

6. **Condensation with Ammonia**: Benzaldehyde reacts with ammonia to form an imine, a type of Schiff base.
   $$ \ce{C_6H_5CHO + NH_3 -> C_6H_5CH=NH + H_2O} $$

## Summary

Benzaldehyde is a key aromatic aldehyde with important chemical reactivity, particularly due to the presence of the carbonyl group. It can undergo various reactions like oxidation, reduction, condensation, and acetal formation. Understanding its properties is essential for its use in synthetic organic chemistry, especially in the production of dyes, fragrances, and as a starting material in the synthesis of other organic compounds.

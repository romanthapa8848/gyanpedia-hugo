# Reaction of Primary Amines with Chloroform, Conc. HCl, R-X, RCOX, and Nitrous Acid (NaNO₂ / HCl)

Primary amines undergo several reactions with different reagents, including chloroform, concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl), alkyl halides, acyl halides, and nitrous acid. These reactions are crucial for the formation of various products, such as isocyanides, amides, and diazonium salts.

## 1. **Reaction with Chloroform and Conc. HCl (The Isocyanide or Carbylamine Reaction)**

When a primary amine reacts with chloroform ($\ce{CHCl_3}$) in the presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid (conc. $\ce{HCl}$), it forms an **isocyanide** (also known as carbylamine). The reaction is highly characteristic for primary amines.

**Reaction:**
$$\ce{R-NH_2 + CHCl_3 + 3NaOH → R-N=C=O + 3NaCl + 2H_2O}$$

**Product**: Isocyanide (Carbylamine)

**Test**: The formation of an isocyanide is used as a qualitative test for primary amines. The isocyanide is typically a foul-smelling compound.

---

## 2. **Reaction with Alkyl Halides (R-X) – Alkylation of Amines**

Primary amines react with alkyl halides (R-X) to form **secondary amines**. This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction, where the amine nitrogen acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of the alkyl halide.

**Reaction:**
$$\ce{R-NH_2 + R-X → R-NH-R + HX}$$

**Product**: Secondary amine (R-NH-R) and HX (hydrogen halide)

---

## 3. **Reaction with Acyl Halides (RCOX) – Formation of Amides**

Primary amines react with acyl halides (RCOX) to form **amides**. The nitrogen of the amine attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the acyl halide, resulting in the formation of an amide and the release of hydrogen chloride (HCl).

**Reaction:**
$$\ce{R-NH_2 + RCOX → R-NH-CO-R + HX}$$

**Product**: Amide (R-NH-CO-R) and HX (hydrogen halide)

---

## 4. **Reaction with Nitrous Acid (NaNO₂ / HCl) – Formation of Diazonium Salt**

When primary amines are treated with nitrous acid (NaNO₂) in the presence of hydrochloric acid (HCl), **diazonium salts** are formed. This is a crucial reaction in the synthesis of azo compounds, where the amine is first converted into a diazonium ion.

**Reaction:**
$$\ce{R-NH_2 + NaNO_2 + HCl → R-N_2^+ Cl^- + H_2O}$$

**Product**: Diazonium salt ($\ce{R-N_2^+ Cl^-}$)

**Example**: 
- **Aniline** ($\ce{C_6H_5NH_2}$) forms **phenyl diazonium chloride** ($\ce{C_6H_5N_2Cl}$) upon reaction with nitrous acid.

---

## Summary

- **Reaction with chloroform and conc. HCl**: Forms isocyanides (carbylamines) – a characteristic test for primary amines.
- **Reaction with alkyl halides (R-X)**: Forms secondary amines by alkylation.
- **Reaction with acyl halides (RCOX)**: Forms amides by nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon.
- **Reaction with nitrous acid (NaNO₂ / HCl)**: Forms diazonium salts, important for azo compound synthesis.

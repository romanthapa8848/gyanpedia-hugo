# Test of 1º, 2º, and 3º Amines (Nitrous Acid Test)

The nitrous acid test is a well-known qualitative test used to distinguish between primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. The test involves the reaction of amines with nitrous acid (generated in situ from sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid) and leads to different results depending on the type of amine present.

## **Reaction of Primary Amines (1º) with Nitrous Acid**

When primary amines react with nitrous acid ($\ce{NaNO_2 / HCl}$), they form **diazonium salts**. This reaction is a characteristic feature of primary amines.

**Reaction:**
$$\ce{R-NH_2 + NaNO_2 + HCl → R-N_2^+ Cl^- + H_2O}$$

**Product**: Diazonium salt ($\ce{R-N_2^+ Cl^-}$)

The formation of diazonium salts is a positive test for primary amines. The diazonium ion is highly reactive and can be further used to synthesize azo compounds.

---

## **Reaction of Secondary Amines (2º) with Nitrous Acid**

Secondary amines do not form diazonium salts upon reaction with nitrous acid. Instead, they undergo a **N-nitrosation reaction** to form **N-nitrosoamines**.

**Reaction:**
$$\ce{R_2NH + NaNO_2 + HCl → R_2N-N=O + H_2O}$$

**Product**: N-nitrosoamine ($\ce{R_2N-N=O}$)

The formation of N-nitrosoamines indicates the presence of secondary amines.

---

## **Reaction of Tertiary Amines (3º) with Nitrous Acid**

Tertiary amines do not react with nitrous acid in the same way as primary or secondary amines. When tertiary amines are treated with nitrous acid, no significant reaction occurs, and **no diazonium salt** or **N-nitrosoamine** is formed.

**Reaction:**
$$\ce{R_3N + NaNO_2 + HCl → No reaction}$$

Therefore, tertiary amines are unreactive in the nitrous acid test, which helps distinguish them from primary and secondary amines.

## Summary

- **Primary amines (1º)** react with nitrous acid to form **diazonium salts**, which is a positive test for primary amines.
- **Secondary amines (2º)** react with nitrous acid to form **N-nitrosoamines**, distinguishing them from primary amines.
- **Tertiary amines (3º)** do not react with nitrous acid, indicating the absence of reactive groups that can form diazonium salts or N-nitrosoamines.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the product formed when primary amines react with nitrous acid?
The product formed is **diazonium salt** ($\ce{R-N_2^+ Cl^-}$).

### 2. What happens when secondary amines react with nitrous acid?
Secondary amines form **N-nitrosoamines** ($\ce{R_2N-N=O}$) when treated with nitrous acid.

### 3. Do tertiary amines react with nitrous acid?
No, **tertiary amines** do not react with nitrous acid and show no significant reaction.

### 4. How can you differentiate between primary, secondary, and tertiary amines using the nitrous acid test?
- **Primary amines** form **diazonium salts**.
- **Secondary amines** form **N-nitrosoamines**.
- **Tertiary amines** show **no reaction**.

### 5. What is the significance of the nitrous acid test?
The nitrous acid test is used to distinguish between primary, secondary, and tertiary amines based on their reactivity with nitrous acid.

### 6. Can secondary amines form diazonium salts in the nitrous acid test?
No, secondary amines do not form **diazonium salts** but form **N-nitrosoamines** instead.

### 7. What is a characteristic feature of the reaction between primary amines and nitrous acid?
The formation of **diazonium salts** is a characteristic feature when primary amines react with nitrous acid.

### 8. Are tertiary amines reactive with nitrous acid?
No, tertiary amines are **unreactive** with nitrous acid and do not form any significant products.

### 9. How is the nitrous acid test useful in organic chemistry?
The nitrous acid test is useful in identifying the type of amine (primary, secondary, or tertiary) and is important for further reactions, such as azo compound synthesis.

### 10. What is the role of sodium nitrite in the nitrous acid test?
Sodium nitrite ($\ce{NaNO_2}$) reacts with hydrochloric acid ($\ce{HCl}$) to generate **nitrous acid** ($\ce{HNO_2}$), which is the reagent responsible for the reaction with the amines.

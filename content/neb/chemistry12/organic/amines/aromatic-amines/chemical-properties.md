# Chemical Properties of Aniline
Aniline is an organic compound with the formula $\ce{C6H5NH2}$, consisting of a phenyl group ($\ce{C6H5}$) attached to an amino group ($\ce{NH2}$). It exhibits several chemical properties due to the electron-donating nature of the amino group.

## Basicity of Aniline
Aniline is a weak base. The nitrogen in the amino group has a lone pair of electrons that can accept a proton, making it basic. However, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen is delocalized into the aromatic ring, which reduces its availability for protonation, making it less basic than aliphatic amines.

## Comparison of Basic Nature of Aniline with Aliphatic Amines and Ammonia
- **Aniline**: The amino group in aniline is less available for protonation due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the benzene ring, making it less basic than aliphatic amines.
- **Aliphatic Amines**: In aliphatic amines, the amino group is not delocalized into a ring, making the lone pair on nitrogen more available to accept a proton. Therefore, aliphatic amines are more basic than aniline.
- **Ammonia**: Ammonia is a weaker base compared to aliphatic amines, but its basicity is similar to that of aniline because it does not have the electron-donating effect of the alkyl group.

## Alkylation
Alkylation of aniline occurs when an alkyl group ($\ce{R}$) replaces one of the hydrogen atoms on the nitrogen. This reaction leads to the formation of N-alkylated aniline derivatives. The process usually requires a strong electrophile, such as an alkyl halide, and a base to neutralize the produced acid.

## Acylation
In acylation, aniline reacts with an acyl group ($\ce{RCO}$) to form an amide. The reaction typically occurs in the presence of an acid chloride ($\ce{RCOCl}$) and a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride ($\ce{AlCl3}$). This reaction is used to form aniline derivatives for various applications.

## Diazotization
Diazotization is a process in which aniline reacts with nitrous acid ($\ce{HNO2}$) to form a diazonium salt ($\ce{C6H5N2^+}$). The reaction is highly useful in the synthesis of aromatic compounds, especially in the formation of azo dyes.

## Carbylamine Reaction
The carbylamine reaction involves the reaction of aniline with chloroform ($\ce{CHCl3}$) and a base (usually potassium hydroxide) to form an isocyanide (carbylamine). This reaction is used for the detection of primary amines.

## Coupling Reaction
Aniline undergoes coupling reactions, especially with diazonium salts, to form azo compounds. The coupling reaction between aniline and diazonium salts is widely used in the dye industry.

## Electrophilic Substitution Reactions

### Nitration
Aniline undergoes nitration when treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid ($\ce{HNO3}$) and sulfuric acid ($\ce{H2SO4}$). The amino group activates the benzene ring, making it more susceptible to attack by the nitronium ion ($\ce{NO2^+}$), resulting in the formation of nitroaniline.

### Sulphonation
Aniline undergoes sulphonation when treated with fuming sulfuric acid ($\ce{H2SO4}$) or concentrated sulfuric acid. The amino group activates the benzene ring towards electrophilic substitution, and the sulfonic acid group ($\ce{SO3H}$) is introduced at the para position to the amino group.

### Bromination
Bromination of aniline involves the reaction of aniline with bromine ($\ce{Br2}$), often in the presence of an aqueous medium. The amino group activates the aromatic ring, leading to the substitution of a bromine atom, usually at the para position relative to the amino group.

## Summary
Aniline is a weak base due to the delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair into the aromatic ring, which makes it less basic than aliphatic amines. It undergoes a variety of reactions including alkylation, acylation, diazotization, and carbylamine formation. It also participates in electrophilic substitution reactions such as nitration, sulphonation, and bromination, leading to the formation of useful derivatives.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the basicity of aniline?
Aniline is a weak base. The amino group can accept a proton, but its basicity is reduced due to the delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair into the aromatic ring.

### 2. How does aniline compare to aliphatic amines in terms of basicity?
Aniline is less basic than aliphatic amines because the lone pair on nitrogen is delocalized into the aromatic ring, reducing its availability for protonation.

### 3. What is the alkylation reaction of aniline?
Alkylation of aniline involves the substitution of one of the hydrogen atoms on nitrogen with an alkyl group, forming N-alkylated aniline derivatives.

### 4. What is acylation of aniline?
Acylation of aniline is the reaction with an acyl group ($\ce{RCO}$), forming an amide. This is commonly carried out using acid chlorides and a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride.

### 5. What is diazotization in aniline chemistry?
Diazotization is the process where aniline reacts with nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt ($\ce{C6H5N2^+}$), which is a crucial intermediate for the synthesis of azo compounds.

### 6. What is the carbylamine reaction of aniline?
The carbylamine reaction involves aniline reacting with chloroform and a base to form an isocyanide (carbylamine), used for detecting primary amines.

### 7. How does aniline undergo a coupling reaction?
Aniline undergoes a coupling reaction with diazonium salts to form azo compounds, which are widely used in dyeing applications.

### 8. What is the nitration reaction of aniline?
Nitration of aniline involves the substitution of a nitro group ($\ce{NO2}$) onto the benzene ring of aniline, activated by the amino group, typically using a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids.

### 9. What is sulphonation in aniline chemistry?
Sulphonation of aniline introduces a sulfonic acid group ($\ce{SO3H}$) onto the benzene ring, usually at the para position to the amino group, when treated with concentrated sulfuric acid.

### 10. How does aniline undergo bromination?
Bromination of aniline leads to the substitution of a bromine atom on the benzene ring, activated by the amino group. This typically occurs at the para position relative to the amino group.

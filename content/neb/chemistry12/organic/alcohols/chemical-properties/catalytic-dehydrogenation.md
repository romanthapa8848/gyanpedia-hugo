# Catalytic Dehydrogenation of 1º and 2º Alcohols and Dehydration of 3º Alcohols

The catalytic dehydrogenation and dehydration of alcohols are important reactions in organic synthesis, as they lead to the formation of **carbon-carbon double bonds** or **carbonyl compounds**.

## 1. Catalytic Dehydrogenation of Primary and Secondary Alcohols

### Primary Alcohols:
Primary alcohols undergo **dehydrogenation** in the presence of a catalyst (e.g., **Cu**, **Cr₂O₃**) to form **aldehydes**. The general reaction is:

$$ \ce{R-CH_2OH \xrightarrow{Cu, \Delta} R-CHO + H_2} $$  
(Primary alcohol to aldehyde)

- **Example**: Dehydrogenation of **ethanol** to **acetaldehyde**:
  $$ \ce{CH_3CH_2OH \xrightarrow{Cu, \Delta} CH_3CHO + H_2} $$

### Secondary Alcohols:
Secondary alcohols undergo **dehydrogenation** to form **ketones**. The reaction is as follows:

$$ \ce{R_2CHOH \xrightarrow{Cu, \Delta} R_2CO + H_2} $$  
(Secondary alcohol to ketone)

- **Example**: Dehydrogenation of **isopropyl alcohol** to **acetone**:
  $$ \ce{(CH_3)_2CHOH \xrightarrow{Cu, \Delta} (CH_3)_2CO + H_2} $$

The reaction requires heat and a suitable catalyst, such as **copper (Cu)** or **chromium oxide (Cr₂O₃)**, to facilitate the removal of **hydrogen** from the alcohol and form the corresponding aldehyde or ketone.

## 2. Dehydration of Tertiary Alcohols

### Tertiary Alcohols:
Tertiary alcohols undergo **dehydration** (elimination of water) in the presence of an acid catalyst (e.g., **H₂SO₄** or **H₃PO₄**) to form **alkenes**. This occurs because tertiary alcohols are **more stable** due to the formation of a stable **carbocation intermediate** during the reaction.

$$ \ce{R_3COH \xrightarrow{H^+, \Delta} R_3C=CH_2 + H_2O} $$  
(Tertiary alcohol to alkene)

- **Example**: Dehydration of **2-methyl-2-propanol** (tert-butanol) to **isobutene**:
  $$ \ce{(CH_3)_3COH \xrightarrow{H_2SO_4, \Delta} (CH_3)_2C=CH_2 + H_2O} $$

### Mechanism of Dehydration:
1. The alcohol is protonated under acidic conditions, making the hydroxyl group a good leaving group.
2. A **carbocation** intermediate is formed after the departure of **water**.
3. The carbocation undergoes **elimination** of a proton to form the **alkene**.

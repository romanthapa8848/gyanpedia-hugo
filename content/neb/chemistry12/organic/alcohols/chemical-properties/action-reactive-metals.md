# Action of Alcohols with Reactive Metals (Na, K, Li)

Alcohols react with **reactive metals** such as **sodium (Na)**, **potassium (K)**, and **lithium (Li)** to form **alkoxides** and **hydrogen gas**. These reactions are exothermic and typically occur readily with alcohols, especially primary alcohols. This reaction is an example of an **oxidation-reduction** process where the metal donates electrons to the alcohol, resulting in the formation of alkoxide ions and the evolution of hydrogen gas.

## 1. **Reaction with Sodium (Na)**

When alcohols react with **sodium metal (Na)**, they form **alkoxides** and release **hydrogen gas**. This is a typical reaction for alcohols, where the **hydroxyl group (-OH)** is replaced by a sodium ion, leading to the formation of an alkoxide ion ($\ce{RO}^-$).

- **Reaction Mechanism**: Sodium reacts with alcohol, displacing the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group, forming **sodium alkoxide** and **hydrogen gas**.

- **Example** (Using **Sodium** for Ethanol):  
  $$ \ce{2CH₃CH₂OH + 2Na \rightarrow 2CH₃CH₂ONa + H₂} $$  
  (Ethanol reacts with sodium to form sodium ethoxide and hydrogen gas)

## 2. **Reaction with Potassium (K)**

Potassium metal (K) reacts with alcohols similarly to sodium, producing **alkoxides** and **hydrogen gas**. The reaction is more vigorous than with sodium due to the higher reactivity of potassium.

- **Reaction Mechanism**: Potassium displaces the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group in alcohols, forming **potassium alkoxide** and evolving **hydrogen gas**.

- **Example** (Using **Potassium** for Methanol):  
  $$ \ce{2CH₃OH + 2K \rightarrow 2CH₃OK + H₂} $$  
  (Methanol reacts with potassium to form potassium methoxide and hydrogen gas)

## 3. **Reaction with Lithium (Li)**

The reaction of alcohols with **lithium metal (Li)** is less vigorous than with sodium and potassium but still leads to the formation of **lithium alkoxides** and **hydrogen gas**. The reaction is similar in nature to that with sodium and potassium but is milder.

- **Reaction Mechanism**: Lithium reacts with alcohol, producing **lithium alkoxide** and **hydrogen gas**.

- **Example** (Using **Lithium** for Isopropanol):  
  $$ \ce{2(CH₃)₂CHOH + 2Li \rightarrow 2(CH₃)₂COLi + H₂} $$  
  (Isopropanol reacts with lithium to form lithium isopropoxide and hydrogen gas)

## Summary

- Alcohols react with reactive metals like **Na**, **K**, and **Li** to form **alkoxides** and release **hydrogen gas**.
- The reaction involves the displacement of the hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group by the metal, leading to the formation of alkoxide ions.
- **Sodium (Na)**, **Potassium (K)**, and **Lithium (Li)** all show this typical behavior, but the reactivity increases as we move down the group in the periodic table.

## FAQs

### 1. What is formed when alcohol reacts with sodium?  
**Sodium alkoxide** and **hydrogen gas** are produced when alcohol reacts with sodium.

### 2. What is the product when alcohol reacts with potassium?  
The reaction with potassium forms **potassium alkoxide** and **hydrogen gas**.

### 3. Does lithium react with alcohols?  
Yes, lithium reacts with alcohols to form **lithium alkoxide** and **hydrogen gas**, though the reaction is milder compared to sodium and potassium.

### 4. Why is potassium more reactive than sodium in alcohol reactions?  
Potassium is more reactive due to its lower ionization energy compared to sodium, making it more easily able to displace the hydrogen atom from the alcohol.

### 5. What happens when alcohol reacts with lithium?  
Alcohol reacts with lithium to form **lithium alkoxide** and **hydrogen gas**.

### 6. How is the reaction of alcohols with sodium different from potassium?  
The reaction with sodium is less vigorous than with potassium, as potassium is a more reactive metal.

### 7. Why do these reactions produce hydrogen gas?  
The **hydrogen gas** is produced because the metal (Na, K, or Li) displaces the hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group (-OH), leading to the formation of alkoxides and the release of hydrogen.

### 8. What is the general mechanism for alcohols reacting with reactive metals?  
The **hydrogen atom** from the hydroxyl group is replaced by the metal, forming an alkoxide and releasing hydrogen gas.

### 9. Can alcohols react with all metals?  
No, alcohols typically react with **reactive metals** like **Na**, **K**, and **Li**. Less reactive metals do not react in the same way.

### 10. What is the importance of alcohol-metal reactions in organic chemistry?  
These reactions are used to prepare **alkoxides**, which are important intermediates in various organic reactions.

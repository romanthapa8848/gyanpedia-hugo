# Test of Ethanol

Ethanol, a common alcohol, can be identified using several chemical tests. Below are the most common tests for ethanol, which are useful in distinguishing ethanol from other organic compounds.

## 1. Sodium Metal Test

**Test:** When ethanol reacts with **sodium metal ($\ce{Na}$)**, it produces **sodium ethoxide ($\ce{C_2H_5ONa}$)** and **hydrogen gas ($\ce{H_2}$)**.

**Reaction:**

$$ \ce{2C_2H_5OH + 2Na \xrightarrow{} 2C_2H_5ONa + H_2} $$

**Observation:**  
- The reaction produces **hydrogen gas** with the evolution of bubbles, and a **white precipitate** of sodium ethoxide is formed.

## 2. Chromic Acid Test (Oxidation Test)

**Test:** In the presence of **chromic acid ($\ce{H_2CrO_4}$)** or **potassium dichromate ($\ce{K_2Cr_2O_7}$)**, ethanol is oxidized to **acetic acid ($\ce{CH_3COOH}$)**. The orange color of the chromic acid or dichromate solution changes to **green** due to the reduction of chromium.

**Reaction:**

$$ \ce{C_2H_5OH + [O] \xrightarrow{H_2CrO_4} CH_3COOH} $$

**Observation:**  
- The **orange color** of the potassium dichromate or chromic acid changes to **green**, indicating the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid.

## 3. Iodoform Test

**Test:** Ethanol gives a **positive iodoform test** when treated with **iodine ($\ce{I_2}$)** and **sodium hydroxide ($\ce{NaOH}$)**. Ethanol is oxidized to **acetaldehyde ($\ce{CH_3CHO}$)**, which reacts with iodine to form a **yellow precipitate of iodoform ($\ce{CHI_3}$)**.

**Reaction:**

$$ \ce{CH_3CHO + 3I_2 + 4NaOH \xrightarrow{} CHI_3 + CH_3COONa + 3NaI + 3H_2O} $$

**Observation:**  
- A **yellow precipitate** of **iodoform ($\ce{CHI_3}$)** is formed.

## 4. Dehydration with Concentrated Sulfuric Acid

**Test:** Ethanol undergoes **dehydration** when heated with **concentrated sulfuric acid ($\ce{H_2SO_4}$)**, forming **ethene ($\ce{C_2H_4}$)**, which can be tested by its reaction with bromine.

**Reaction:**

$$ \ce{C_2H_5OH \xrightarrow{H_2SO_4 (conc.), heat} C_2H_4 + H_2O} $$

**Observation:**  
- The reaction produces **ethene** gas, which can be tested by its **bromine water decolorization**.

## 5. Lucas Test

**Test:** The **Lucas test** is used to differentiate between primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. Ethanol is a **primary alcohol** and reacts with **Lucas reagent** (a mixture of **zinc chloride ($\ce{ZnCl_2}$)** and **hydrochloric acid ($\ce{HCl}$)**) to form **ethyl chloride**.

**Reaction:**

$$ \ce{C_2H_5OH + HCl \xrightarrow{ZnCl_2} C_2H_5Cl + H_2O} $$

**Observation:**  
- The reaction produces **ethyl chloride**, and the solution becomes **cloudy**.

## Summary

- **Sodium Metal Test**: Ethanol reacts with sodium metal to form sodium ethoxide and hydrogen gas.
- **Chromic Acid Test**: Ethanol is oxidized to acetic acid in the presence of chromic acid, and the color changes from orange to green.
- **Iodoform Test**: Ethanol gives a yellow precipitate of iodoform when treated with iodine and sodium hydroxide.
- **Dehydration with Concentrated Sulfuric Acid**: Ethanol undergoes dehydration to form ethene.
- **Lucas Test**: Ethanol reacts with Lucas reagent to form ethyl chloride.

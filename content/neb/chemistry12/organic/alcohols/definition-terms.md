# Common Terms Related to Alcohols

In the context of alcohols, various terms refer to specific types and uses of alcohol. Below are the definitions of some of the most commonly used terms related to alcohol.

## 1. **Absolute Alcohol**

**Absolute alcohol** refers to **pure ethanol** that is nearly free from water. It is typically obtained by removing the water from ethanol through a drying agent like anhydrous calcium oxide or by using **distillation**. Absolute alcohol is highly volatile and is used in laboratories, as a solvent, and in some industrial applications.

### Key points:
- Nearly **pure ethanol (99% or more)**.
- **Contains little or no water**.
- Used in laboratories and industrial applications.

## 2. **Power Alcohol**

**Power alcohol** is a mixture of **ethyl alcohol (ethanol)** and **petrol** (gasoline) that is used as an **alternative fuel** in internal combustion engines. The typical composition of power alcohol is about **85% ethanol** and **15% petrol**. It is used to increase the efficiency of engines and reduce the consumption of gasoline.

### Key points:
- Mixture of **ethanol and petrol**.
- Used as a fuel in **internal combustion engines**.
- Helps reduce **gasoline consumption**.

## 3. **Denatured Alcohol (Methylated Spirit)**

**Denatured alcohol** (also known as **methylated spirit**) refers to ethanol that has been treated with certain chemicals (denaturants) to make it undrinkable. This is done to avoid the alcohol tax and is commonly used as a **solvent**, **fuel**, or in **cleaning** products. Denatured alcohol often contains **methanol**, **pyridine**, or other substances that render it poisonous or unpleasant to consume.

### Key points:
- **Ethanol treated with chemicals** (like methanol) to make it undrinkable.
- Used as a **solvent**, **fuel**, or in **cleaning**.
- It is **poisonous** if consumed.

## 4. **Rectified Spirit**

**Rectified spirit** refers to **ethanol** that has been purified through repeated **distillation** to remove impurities and water. It typically has an alcohol content of about **95%**. It is commonly used in the manufacture of alcoholic beverages, perfumes, and medicinal preparations.

### Key points:
- **Highly concentrated ethanol (about 95%)**.
- Obtained by repeated **distillation**.
- Used in the production of **alcoholic beverages**, **perfumes**, and **medicines**.

## 5. **Alcoholic Beverages**

**Alcoholic beverages** are drinks that contain **ethanol** (alcohol) and are consumed for their intoxicating effects. These beverages are produced by the fermentation of sugars in fruits, grains, or other sources. Common examples include **beer**, **wine**, **whisky**, **vodka**, and **rum**.

### Key points:
- Drinks containing **ethanol**.
- Produced by the **fermentation** of sugars.
- Examples include **beer**, **wine**, **whisky**, and **vodka**.

| **Primary Use**                   | Laboratory, industrial | Fuel in engines   | Solvent, fuel, cleaning | Alcoholic beverages, perfumes, medicines | Drinking, recreational |
| **Toxicity**                       | Toxic if consumed    | Safe for use as fuel | Toxic, undrinkable    | Non-toxic (for consumption) | Non-toxic (for consumption) |
| **Distillation**                  | Not needed           | No distillation required | Required for removal of impurities | Required to remove water | No distillation (fermentation process) |
| **Examples**                       | Pure ethanol         | Mixture of ethanol and petrol | Methylated spirits | High-proof ethanol   | Beer, wine, whisky, rum |

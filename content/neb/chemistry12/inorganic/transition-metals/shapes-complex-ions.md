# Shapes of Complex Ions

The shape or geometry of a complex ion depends on the **coordination number** of the central metal ion and the nature of the ligands involved. Coordination number refers to the number of bonds formed between the central metal ion and the surrounding ligands. The shapes of complex ions play a crucial role in determining the properties and reactivity of these complexes.

## Types of Shapes Based on Coordination Number

### 1. **Coordination Number 2**
When the coordination number is 2, the complex ion generally adopts a **linear shape**. This is common for **metal ions** with a low charge and relatively small size.

- **Example:** $[Ag(NH_3)_2]^+$ (Silver-ammonia complex)

- **Shape:** Linear (180° bond angle)

### 2. **Coordination Number 4**
When the coordination number is 4, the complex ion can adopt either a **tetrahedral** or **square planar** shape, depending on the metal ion and its electronic configuration.

- **Tetrahedral Geometry:**
  - **Example:** $[NiCl_4]^{2-}$ (Nickel-chlorine complex)
  - **Shape:** Tetrahedral (109.5° bond angle)
  
- **Square Planar Geometry:**
  - **Example:** $[PtCl_4]^{2-}$ (Platinum-chlorine complex)
  - **Shape:** Square planar (90° bond angle)

The **square planar** geometry is more common for metal ions with a **d^8** electronic configuration, such as **Platinum(II)**, **Palladium(II)**, and **Gold(III)**.

### 3. **Coordination Number 6**
When the coordination number is 6, the complex ion adopts an **octahedral shape**, which is one of the most common geometries for metal complexes.

- **Example:** $[Fe(CO)_6]^{2+}$ (Iron-carbonyl complex)
- **Shape:** Octahedral (90° bond angle)

This geometry occurs when the metal ion has a **high charge** and a relatively **large size**, allowing it to form six bonds.

## Factors Influencing the Shape of Complex Ions

### 1. **Coordination Number**
The **coordination number** determines the possible geometry of the complex. For example:
- Coordination number **2** leads to a **linear** shape.
- Coordination number **4** leads to either **tetrahedral** or **square planar** shapes.
- Coordination number **6** leads to an **octahedral** shape.

### 2. **Nature of Ligands**
The type and size of ligands can influence the geometry of the complex. **Large ligands** tend to favor **tetrahedral** shapes, while **smaller ligands** like **ammonia ($NH_3$)** often result in **octahedral** or **square planar** geometries.

### 3. **Electronic Configuration of the Metal Ion**
The electronic configuration of the metal ion also plays a significant role in determining the shape. Transition metals with different electron configurations may favor specific geometries based on factors such as **ligand-electron interactions** and **crystal field splitting**.

| 6                       | Octahedral                  | 90°                         | $[Fe(CO)_6]^{2+}$                |

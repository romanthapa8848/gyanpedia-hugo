# Half-life of Zero and First Order Reactions

The **half-life** ($t_{1/2}$) of a reaction is the time required for half of the reactant to be consumed in the reaction. The concept of half-life is crucial in understanding the progression of a chemical reaction. For different orders of reactions, the half-life expression varies, depending on how the concentration of reactants influences the rate of the reaction.

### Zero-Order Reaction

For a **zero-order reaction**, the rate of reaction is independent of the concentration of the reactant. The rate law is:

$$ \text{Rate} = k $$

For a reaction:

$$ A \rightarrow B $$

The integrated rate law for a zero-order reaction is:

$$ [A] = [A]_0 - kt $$

The half-life for a zero-order reaction can be derived from the integrated rate law. The half-life is the time at which half of the initial concentration of the reactant is consumed:

$$ [A] = \frac{[A]_0}{2} $$

Substituting into the integrated rate law:

$$ \frac{[A]_0}{2} = [A]_0 - kt_{1/2} $$

Simplifying:

$$ t_{1/2} = \frac{[A]_0}{2k} $$

Thus, for a zero-order reaction, the half-life is directly proportional to the initial concentration of the reactant and inversely proportional to the rate constant $k$.

### First-Order Reaction

For a **first-order reaction**, the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant. The rate law is:

$$ \text{Rate} = k[A] $$

For a reaction:

$$ A \rightarrow B $$

The integrated rate law for a first-order reaction is:

$$ \ln[A] = \ln[A]_0 - kt $$

The half-life for a first-order reaction is calculated in a similar manner. At the half-life:

$$ \ln\left(\frac{[A]_0}{2}\right) = \ln[A]_0 - kt_{1/2} $$

Simplifying:

$$ \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -kt_{1/2} $$

Since $ \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -0.693 $, the equation becomes:

$$ t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{k} $$

Thus, for a first-order reaction, the half-life is constant and independent of the initial concentration of the reactant. It only depends on the rate constant $k$.

## Comparison of Zero and First-Order Reactions' Half-Lives

| **Reaction Order**  | **Expression for Half-life**      | **Dependence on Initial Concentration**  | **Dependence on Rate Constant**  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Zero-Order Reaction | $ t_{1/2} = \frac{[A]_0}{2k} $    | Directly proportional to $[A]_0$        | Inversely proportional to $k$   |
| First-Order Reaction| $ t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{k} $     | Independent of $[A]_0$                  | Inversely proportional to $k$   |

## Summary

The half-life of a reaction is an important concept that tells us the time required for half of the reactant to be consumed. 
- For a **zero-order reaction**, the half-life is **directly proportional** to the initial concentration and **inversely proportional** to the rate constant. 
- For a **first-order reaction**, the half-life is **independent** of the initial concentration and is **constant**, depending only on the rate constant.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the half-life of a zero-order reaction?

The half-life of a zero-order reaction is given by:

$$ t_{1/2} = \frac{[A]_0}{2k} $$

where $[A]_0$ is the initial concentration and $k$ is the rate constant.

### 2. What is the half-life of a first-order reaction?

The half-life of a first-order reaction is given by:

$$ t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{k} $$

where $k$ is the rate constant.

### 3. Does the half-life depend on the initial concentration for a zero-order reaction?

Yes, the half-life for a zero-order reaction is directly proportional to the initial concentration.

### 4. Does the half-life depend on the initial concentration for a first-order reaction?

No, the half-life for a first-order reaction is constant and independent of the initial concentration.

### 5. What happens to the half-life as the rate constant increases for a zero-order reaction?

For a zero-order reaction, as the rate constant $k$ increases, the half-life decreases.

### 6. What happens to the half-life as the rate constant increases for a first-order reaction?

For a first-order reaction, as the rate constant $k$ increases, the half-life decreases, but it remains independent of the initial concentration.

### 7. Can the half-life be used to determine the rate constant for a reaction?

Yes, by using the half-life equation for the respective order of reaction, the rate constant can be calculated if the half-life is known.

### 8. Does the half-life change during the course of the reaction for a zero-order reaction?

Yes, for a zero-order reaction, the half-life decreases as the reaction progresses since it depends on the initial concentration.

### 9. Does the half-life change during the course of the reaction for a first-order reaction?

No, for a first-order reaction, the half-life remains constant throughout the reaction.

### 10. Why is the half-life for a first-order reaction independent of the initial concentration?

This is because the rate of the reaction for a first-order reaction is proportional to the concentration of the reactant, and the logarithmic relationship between concentration and time results in a constant half-life.

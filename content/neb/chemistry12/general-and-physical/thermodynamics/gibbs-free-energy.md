# Gibbs' Free Energy and Prediction of Spontaneity

Gibbs' free energy ($G$) is a thermodynamic quantity that combines enthalpy ($H$), entropy ($S$), and temperature ($T$) to predict whether a chemical reaction will occur spontaneously. The equation for Gibbs' free energy is:

$$
G = H - TS
$$

Where:
- $G$ is the Gibbs free energy,
- $H$ is the enthalpy,
- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin,
- $S$ is the entropy.

### Statement of the Gibbs' Free Energy:
Gibbs' free energy helps determine the spontaneity of a process by examining the changes in enthalpy and entropy at a constant temperature. It predicts the direction of a reaction:

> **If $\Delta G < 0$, the reaction is spontaneous. If $\Delta G > 0$, the reaction is non-spontaneous. If $\Delta G = 0$, the system is at equilibrium.**

### Factors Affecting Gibbs' Free Energy:
- **Enthalpy ($\Delta H$)**: A measure of the total energy of a system. A negative change in enthalpy ($\Delta H < 0$) generally favors spontaneity.
- **Entropy ($\Delta S$)**: A measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. An increase in entropy ($\Delta S > 0$) generally favors spontaneity.
- **Temperature ($T$)**: The effect of temperature on spontaneity depends on the signs of $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$.

### Mathematical Expression for Gibbs' Free Energy Change:
The change in Gibbs' free energy during a process or reaction is given by:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

Where:
- $\Delta G$ is the change in Gibbs free energy,
- $\Delta H$ is the change in enthalpy,
- $\Delta S$ is the change in entropy,
- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

### Conditions for Spontaneity:
- **Spontaneous Reaction**: A reaction is spontaneous if $\Delta G < 0$. This means the system is energetically favorable and will proceed without external input.
- **Non-Spontaneous Reaction**: A reaction is non-spontaneous if $\Delta G > 0$. In this case, the system requires external energy to proceed.
- **Equilibrium**: If $\Delta G = 0$, the system is at equilibrium, meaning there is no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products.

### Applications of Gibbs' Free Energy:
1. **Predicting Reaction Direction**: The sign of $\Delta G$ predicts the direction of the reaction—whether it will proceed forward or reverse.
2. **Phase Changes**: The phase transition between solid, liquid, and gas phases can be understood using Gibbs' free energy, where $\Delta G = 0$ at the phase equilibrium.
3. **Chemical Reactions**: Gibbs' free energy helps in understanding and predicting the spontaneity of chemical reactions in various conditions, such as temperature and pressure.

## Summary

- Gibbs' free energy combines enthalpy and entropy to determine the spontaneity of a process.
- A negative $\Delta G$ indicates spontaneity, while a positive $\Delta G$ suggests non-spontaneity.
- At equilibrium, $\Delta G = 0$.
- The Gibbs free energy equation allows us to predict whether a reaction will occur under certain conditions, providing insights into thermodynamic favorability.

## FAQs

### 1. What is Gibbs' Free Energy?

Gibbs' free energy is a thermodynamic quantity that determines the spontaneity of a process or reaction. It is a combination of enthalpy, entropy, and temperature.

### 2. What does a negative $\Delta G$ mean?

A negative $\Delta G$ indicates that the reaction is spontaneous, meaning it will proceed without external energy input.

### 3. What does a positive $\Delta G$ mean?

A positive $\Delta G$ indicates that the reaction is non-spontaneous and requires external energy to occur.

### 4. How is Gibbs' Free Energy related to temperature?

The temperature ($T$) affects the spontaneity of a reaction by influencing the $T \Delta S$ term in the Gibbs free energy equation. At higher temperatures, reactions with positive $\Delta S$ are more likely to be spontaneous.

### 5. What happens when $\Delta G = 0$?

When $\Delta G = 0$, the system is at equilibrium, meaning there is no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products.

### 6. Can a reaction with positive $\Delta H$ and positive $\Delta S$ be spontaneous?

Yes, if the temperature is high enough, a reaction with positive $\Delta H$ and positive $\Delta S$ can still be spontaneous because the $T \Delta S$ term can outweigh $\Delta H$.

### 7. Can a reaction with negative $\Delta H$ and negative $\Delta S$ be spontaneous?

Yes, if the temperature is low enough, a reaction with negative $\Delta H$ and negative $\Delta S$ can be spontaneous because the $\Delta H$ term can outweigh the $T \Delta S$ term.

### 8. How does Gibbs' Free Energy help in chemical reactions?

Gibbs' free energy helps predict whether a chemical reaction will be spontaneous under certain conditions and whether the reaction will proceed toward equilibrium.

### 9. What is the relationship between Gibbs' Free Energy and equilibrium?

At equilibrium, $\Delta G = 0$. This means there is no further net change in the composition of reactants and products.

### 10. How does Gibbs' Free Energy help in phase transitions?

Gibbs' free energy can explain phase transitions, such as melting or boiling, by showing that $\Delta G = 0$ at the phase equilibrium.

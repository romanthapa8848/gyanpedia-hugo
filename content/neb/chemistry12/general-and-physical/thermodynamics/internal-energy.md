# Internal Energy

**Internal energy** ($U$) refers to the total energy contained within a system due to both the motion of its particles (kinetic energy) and the potential energy associated with the interactions between the particles. It includes the energy stored in the chemical bonds, the energy associated with the vibrations of atoms, and the energy due to the system's temperature.

In thermodynamics, the change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) of a system is important in understanding how energy is transferred during chemical reactions or physical processes. According to the **first law of thermodynamics**, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred between the system and its surroundings. This law is expressed as:

$$ \Delta U = Q - W $$

Where:
- $\Delta U$ is the change in internal energy,
- $Q$ is the heat absorbed by the system,
- $W$ is the work done by the system.

The internal energy change is related to heat and work, and it is critical in calculating the energy required or released during reactions. If a system does work on its surroundings or absorbs heat, its internal energy will change accordingly.

Internal energy is a state function, meaning its value depends only on the state of the system and not on how the system arrived at that state. This makes it different from path functions like heat and work.

## Summary

Internal energy is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics that accounts for both the kinetic and potential energy of particles within a system. It plays a vital role in understanding energy transfer during chemical reactions. The change in internal energy is determined by the heat absorbed and the work done, as described by the first law of thermodynamics.

## FAQs

### 1. What is internal energy?

Internal energy ($U$) is the total energy contained within a system due to both the kinetic and potential energy of its particles. It includes the energy stored in chemical bonds and the energy associated with molecular vibrations.

### 2. How is internal energy related to heat and work?

According to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) of a system is the difference between the heat absorbed ($Q$) and the work done by the system ($W$):
$$ \Delta U = Q - W $$

### 3. Is internal energy a state function?

Yes, internal energy is a state function, meaning its value depends only on the current state of the system and not on the path taken to reach that state.

### 4. What happens to internal energy when work is done by a system?

If work is done by the system on the surroundings, internal energy decreases, assuming no heat is added. The energy used to perform the work comes from the internal energy.

### 5. How is internal energy measured?

Internal energy is usually calculated indirectly by measuring the heat and work exchanges with the surroundings during a process, as it is not possible to measure internal energy directly.

### 6. What is the relationship between internal energy and enthalpy?

Enthalpy ($H$) is related to internal energy by the equation:
$$ H = U + PV $$ 
Where $P$ is pressure and $V$ is volume. Enthalpy is particularly useful when dealing with constant pressure processes.

### 7. Does internal energy change during a phase transition?

Yes, internal energy can change during a phase transition, such as when a substance melts or boils, as heat is absorbed or released without a temperature change.

### 8. Can internal energy be negative?

Internal energy itself cannot be negative, but the change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) can be negative if the system loses energy to its surroundings, for example, during exothermic reactions.

### 9. What factors affect internal energy?

Internal energy is affected by the temperature, pressure, and volume of the system, as well as the chemical composition of the system.

### 10. How does internal energy relate to temperature?

As the temperature of a system increases, the kinetic energy of the particles increases, which in turn increases the internal energy. The relationship between internal energy and temperature depends on the type of system and its specific heat capacity.

# Primary and Secondary Standard Substances

In analytical chemistry, standard substances are crucial for preparing solutions of known concentration. These solutions, called standard solutions, are used to determine the concentration of unknown solutions. There are two types of standard substances: **primary** and **secondary**.

---

## 1. Primary Standard Substances

A **primary standard substance** is one that is pure, stable, non-hygroscopic, and can be weighed accurately. These substances have a known, high degree of purity, which allows them to be used to prepare standard solutions directly. Primary standards are typically used to calibrate secondary standards.

### Characteristics of Primary Standard Substances:
- **High purity**: They must have a known and high degree of purity (usually ≥ 99.9%).
- **Stable**: They should not undergo chemical changes over time.
- **Non-hygroscopic**: They should not absorb moisture from the air, as this could affect their mass and concentration.
- **Accurate**: They can be accurately weighed.
- **React completely**: They should react completely with the substance being tested.

### Examples of Primary Standard Substances:
- **Sodium Carbonate ($Na_2CO_3$)**: Used to standardize acids in titrations.
- **Potassium Dichromate ($K_2Cr_2O_7$)**: Used in redox titrations.
- **Oxalic Acid ($C_2H_2O_4$)**: Used in acid-base titrations.

## 2. Secondary Standard Substances

A **secondary standard substance** is a substance whose concentration is determined by comparing it with a primary standard. Secondary standards are usually prepared from primary standards, and their concentration is not known with the same level of precision as primary standards. They require periodic calibration and are used for routine work in the laboratory.

### Characteristics of Secondary Standard Substances:
- **Concentration needs to be determined**: Their concentration must be determined by titrating against a primary standard.
- **Less purity**: They are not as pure as primary standards and may contain impurities.
- **Stability may vary**: They may be more susceptible to changes over time (e.g., due to exposure to air or moisture).
- **Not directly used for calibration**: They are typically not used to calibrate instruments but are instead used for regular analytical procedures once their concentration is determined.

### Examples of Secondary Standard Substances:
- **Hydrochloric Acid ($HCl$)**: Often used in acid-base titrations but is a secondary standard because its concentration needs to be determined against a primary standard.
- **Sodium Hydroxide ($NaOH$)**: Also a secondary standard, typically standardized against a primary standard like oxalic acid or sodium carbonate.
- **Sodium Thiosulphate ($Na_2S_2O_3$)**: Used in redox titrations but requires standardization before use.

| **Stability**                    | Stable, does not change over time                   | Stability may vary, susceptible to environmental factors   |
| **Hygroscopic**                  | Non-hygroscopic                                     | May be hygroscopic (e.g., HCl)                            |
| **Use**                          | Directly used to prepare standard solutions         | Requires calibration against a primary standard           |
| **Calibration**                  | Used to calibrate secondary standards               | Needs to be calibrated against a primary standard         |
| **Examples**                     | Sodium Carbonate ($Na_2CO_3$), Oxalic Acid ($C_2H_2O_4$) | Hydrochloric Acid ($HCl$), Sodium Hydroxide ($NaOH$)      |
| **Reactivity**                   | Reacts completely with substances being tested      | May require periodic re-standardization                   |
| **Application in Titrations**    | Used for the precise standardization of solutions   | Used for routine work after calibration                   |

## FAQs

### 1. What is a primary standard substance?
A primary standard substance is a highly pure substance used to prepare a standard solution, with known and accurate concentration.

### 2. Why are primary standards preferred over secondary standards?
Primary standards have known purity and stability, allowing for more precise and accurate calibration of solutions.

### 3. Can secondary standard substances be used without calibration?
No, secondary standards require calibration against primary standards before they can be used reliably.

### 4. Why is sodium carbonate a primary standard?
Sodium carbonate is stable, non-hygroscopic, and reacts completely with acids, making it suitable for standardization.

### 5. Can hydrochloric acid be a primary standard?
No, because hydrochloric acid is hygroscopic and its concentration can change over time, requiring it to be standardized against a primary standard.

### 6. How is the concentration of a secondary standard determined?
The concentration of a secondary standard is determined by titrating it against a primary standard.

### 7. What role do primary standards play in titrations?
Primary standards are used to prepare a standard solution with a known concentration, which is essential for accurately determining the concentration of unknown solutions.

### 8. Can secondary standards be stored indefinitely?
No, secondary standards can lose their concentration over time due to environmental factors such as moisture or air exposure.

### 9. Why is oxalic acid used as a primary standard?
Oxalic acid is stable, pure, and non-hygroscopic, making it ideal for use in preparing standard solutions for titration.

### 10. Are secondary standards less reliable than primary standards?
Yes, secondary standards are less reliable because their concentrations are not as precisely known and must be determined by comparison with primary standards.

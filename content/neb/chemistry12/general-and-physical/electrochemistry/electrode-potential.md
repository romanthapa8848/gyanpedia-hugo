# Electrode Potential and Standard Electrode Potential

## Electrode Potential

Electrode potential refers to the ability of an electrode to either lose or gain electrons when it is in contact with its ions in a solution. This potential is crucial in electrochemistry, as it helps us determine the direction of electron flow during redox reactions.

- **Oxidation**: When a substance loses electrons, this occurs at the **anode**.
- **Reduction**: When a substance gains electrons, this occurs at the **cathode**.

The **electrode potential** is a numerical value that helps measure the tendency of a substance to either gain or lose electrons. A **positive potential** indicates a strong tendency to gain electrons (reduction), while a **negative potential** suggests a tendency to lose electrons (oxidation).

## Standard Electrode Potential (E°)

**Standard Electrode Potential (E°)** is the potential measured under standard conditions:
- Temperature: **25°C (298 K)**,
- Concentration of ions: **1 M**,
- Pressure: **1 atm**.

To measure **E°**, the **Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)** is used as a reference. The **SHE** is assigned a potential of **0 V** by convention.

The standard electrode potential of a half-reaction tells us whether the substance is more likely to gain or lose electrons. The **greater the positive potential**, the more likely the substance is to gain electrons and undergo **reduction**.

### Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)

The **Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)** is a reference electrode used to measure the electrode potential of other substances. The SHE consists of a platinum electrode in contact with **hydrogen ions** in a **1 M solution** and **hydrogen gas** at a pressure of **1 atm**. The potential of the SHE is defined as **0 V**.

## FAQs

### 1. What is electrode potential?

Electrode potential is the measure of a substance's ability to either gain or lose electrons when in contact with its ions.

### 2. How is standard electrode potential measured?

Standard electrode potential is measured under standard conditions: 25°C temperature, 1 M ion concentration, and 1 atm pressure.

### 3. What is the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)?

The SHE is a reference electrode with a potential of **0 V**, used to compare other electrode potentials.

### 4. What does a positive electrode potential indicate?

A positive electrode potential means that the substance has a strong tendency to gain electrons (reduction).

### 5. How do you calculate cell potential?

Cell potential is calculated by subtracting the anode potential from the cathode potential:
$$
E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}}
$$

### 6. What is the significance of the SHE being assigned a 0 V potential?

The SHE is assigned a 0 V potential by convention, and it is used as the reference to compare the electrode potentials of other substances.

### 7. How does electrode potential help in predicting redox reactions?

Electrode potential helps predict whether a substance will gain or lose electrons, determining the direction of the redox reaction.

### 8. What is the relationship between electrode potential and spontaneity of reactions?

A **positive cell potential** indicates that a reaction is spontaneous, while a **negative cell potential** indicates a non-spontaneous reaction.

### 9. Can electrode potential change with conditions?

Yes, electrode potential can change with variations in temperature, pressure, and ion concentration.

### 10. What happens at the cathode during a redox reaction?

At the cathode, **reduction** occurs, meaning the substance gains electrons.

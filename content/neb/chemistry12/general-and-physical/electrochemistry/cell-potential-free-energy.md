# Relationship Between Cell Potential and Free Energy

In electrochemistry, the relationship between the **cell potential** and the **free energy** is crucial in understanding whether a reaction will occur spontaneously or not. The free energy change ($\Delta G$) and the cell potential ($E_{\text{cell}}$) are connected through a fundamental equation, which allows us to predict the spontaneity of the reaction based on the values of these two parameters.

## Free Energy and Cell Potential

The **Gibbs Free Energy** ($\Delta G$) is a thermodynamic quantity that helps predict the spontaneity of a reaction. For an electrochemical reaction, the **cell potential** is the electrical potential difference between the two electrodes in the cell, and it indicates the ability of the cell to do electrical work.

The relationship between the **cell potential** and the **Gibbs Free Energy** is given by the following equation:

$$
\Delta G = -nFE_{\text{cell}}
$$

Where:
- $\Delta G$ is the Gibbs free energy change (in joules, J),
- $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction,
- $F$ is the Faraday constant ($\approx 96500$ C/mol),
- $E_{\text{cell}}$ is the cell potential (in volts, V).

This equation tells us that:
- When $E_{\text{cell}}$ is **positive**, $\Delta G$ is **negative**, indicating a **spontaneous** reaction.
- When $E_{\text{cell}}$ is **negative**, $\Delta G$ is **positive**, indicating a **non-spontaneous** reaction.
- When $E_{\text{cell}}$ is **zero**, $\Delta G$ is **zero**, indicating the system is at equilibrium.

## Standard Free Energy Change and Standard Cell Potential

For standard conditions (1 M concentration of ions, 1 atm pressure, and 25°C), the relationship between the **standard cell potential** ($E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$) and the **standard free energy change** ($\Delta G^\circ$) is given by:

$$
\Delta G^\circ = -nFE^\circ_{\text{cell}}
$$

Where:
- $\Delta G^\circ$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change (in joules, J),
- $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$ is the standard cell potential (in volts, V).

For a reaction to be spontaneous under standard conditions, $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$ should be positive, leading to a negative $\Delta G^\circ$.

## Summary

- **Cell Potential** ($E_{\text{cell}}$) and **Free Energy** ($\Delta G$) are inversely related: a positive cell potential indicates a negative free energy change, making the reaction spontaneous.
- The equation $\Delta G = -nFE_{\text{cell}}$ connects the two, where $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.
- For a **spontaneous** reaction, $E_{\text{cell}}$ is positive, and $\Delta G$ is negative. For a **non-spontaneous** reaction, $E_{\text{cell}}$ is negative, and $\Delta G$ is positive.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the relationship between cell potential and free energy?
Cell potential is related to free energy by the equation $\Delta G = -nFE_{\text{cell}}$, where a positive cell potential indicates a negative free energy change, making the reaction spontaneous.

### 2. What does a negative cell potential mean in terms of free energy?
A negative cell potential means the reaction is non-spontaneous, and the free energy change ($\Delta G$) will be positive.

### 3. How does standard cell potential relate to standard free energy change?
Under standard conditions, the relationship is $\Delta G^\circ = -nFE^\circ_{\text{cell}}$, where a positive standard cell potential indicates a negative standard free energy change, making the reaction spontaneous.

### 4. What is the significance of $\Delta G = 0$?
When $\Delta G = 0$, the system is at equilibrium, and there is no net change in the concentration of reactants and products.

### 5. How do I calculate the cell potential for a reaction?
The cell potential is calculated by subtracting the anode potential from the cathode potential:  
$$ E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cathode}} - E_{\text{anode}} $$

### 6. What does a positive standard free energy change indicate?
A positive standard free energy change indicates a non-spontaneous reaction under standard conditions.

### 7. How is Gibbs free energy related to spontaneity?
If $\Delta G$ is negative, the reaction is spontaneous; if $\Delta G$ is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous.

### 8. What is the Faraday constant ($F$)?
The Faraday constant is approximately $96500$ C/mol, and it represents the amount of electric charge per mole of electrons.

### 9. What happens when $\Delta G = 0$?
When $\Delta G = 0$, the electrochemical reaction is at equilibrium, and no net work is done.

### 10. How can I use the relationship between cell potential and free energy?
The relationship can be used to predict whether a reaction will occur spontaneously or not, based on the sign of the cell potential and free energy.

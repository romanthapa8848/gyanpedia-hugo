# Voltaic Cell: Zn-Cu Cell, Ag-Cu Cell

## Introduction to Voltaic Cells

A **voltaic cell** (or galvanic cell) is an electrochemical cell that generates electrical energy from spontaneous redox reactions. In a voltaic cell, two different metals are connected through an electrolyte, and an external circuit allows the flow of electrons from the anode (where oxidation occurs) to the cathode (where reduction occurs). Here, we will discuss the construction and working principles of the **Zn-Cu Voltaic Cell** and **Ag-Cu Voltaic Cell**.

### Zn-Cu Voltaic Cell

The **Zn-Cu cell** is one of the simplest and most common types of voltaic cells. It is constructed using **zinc** and **copper** electrodes immersed in their respective salt solutions.

#### Construction of the Zn-Cu Voltaic Cell

- The **zinc electrode** is immersed in a **zinc sulfate ($\text{ZnSO}_4$)** solution.
- The **copper electrode** is immersed in a **copper sulfate ($\text{CuSO}_4$)** solution.
- The two electrodes are connected by a **wire**, and the electrolyte solutions are separated by a **salt bridge** or a porous barrier to allow ion movement while preventing mixing of the solutions.

#### Working Principle

- The **zinc electrode** acts as the **anode**. It undergoes oxidation, releasing electrons:
  $$ 
  \text{Zn} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^- 
  $$
  The electrons flow from the anode through the external circuit to the **copper electrode**, which acts as the **cathode**.
  
- At the **cathode**, the copper ions from the **$\text{CuSO}_4$** solution are reduced by the electrons arriving from the anode:
  $$ 
  \text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu} 
  $$

- The flow of electrons from the anode to the cathode generates electrical energy, which can be used to power a device.

#### Cell Potential

The **cell potential** of the Zn-Cu voltaic cell can be calculated using the standard electrode potentials of the half-reactions. The standard electrode potential of **$\text{Zn}^{2+}/\text{Zn}$** is **-0.76 V**, and for **$\text{Cu}^{2+}/\text{Cu}$**, it is **+0.34 V**. The cell potential is:
$$
E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}} = (+0.34 \, \text{V}) - (-0.76 \, \text{V}) = +1.10 \, \text{V}
$$

### Ag-Cu Voltaic Cell

The **Ag-Cu cell** is another example of a voltaic cell, similar to the Zn-Cu cell but with **silver (Ag)** as the anode material.

#### Construction of the Ag-Cu Voltaic Cell

- The **silver electrode** is immersed in a **silver nitrate ($\text{AgNO}_3$)** solution.
- The **copper electrode** is immersed in a **copper sulfate ($\text{CuSO}_4$)** solution.
- The two electrodes are connected by a **wire**, and a **salt bridge** or porous barrier separates the two electrolyte solutions.

#### Working Principle

- The **silver electrode** serves as the **anode** and undergoes oxidation, releasing electrons:
  $$ 
  \text{Ag} \rightarrow \text{Ag}^+ + e^- 
  $$

- The electrons flow through the external circuit to the **copper electrode**, which acts as the **cathode**.
  
- At the **cathode**, the copper ions from the **$\text{CuSO}_4$** solution are reduced by the incoming electrons:
  $$ 
  \text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu} 
  $$

- The flow of electrons between the anode and cathode generates electrical energy.

#### Cell Potential

The **cell potential** of the Ag-Cu voltaic cell can be calculated using the standard electrode potentials of the half-reactions. The standard electrode potential of **$\text{Ag}^+/\text{Ag}$** is **+0.799 V**, and for **$\text{Cu}^{2+}/\text{Cu}$**, it is **+0.34 V**. The cell potential is:
$$
E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}} = (+0.34 \, \text{V}) - (+0.799 \, \text{V}) = +0.459 \, \text{V}
$$

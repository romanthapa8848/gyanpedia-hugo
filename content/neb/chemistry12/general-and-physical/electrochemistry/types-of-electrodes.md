# Types of Electrodes: Standard Hydrogen Electrode and Calomel Electrode

## Introduction to Electrodes

In electrochemistry, electrodes are essential components of electrochemical cells, where they serve as sites for oxidation and reduction reactions. Two important types of reference electrodes used in electrochemical measurements are the **Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)** and the **Calomel Electrode**.

### Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)

The **Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)** is a universal reference electrode, commonly used to measure the standard electrode potential of other half-cells. It is the primary reference for determining the electrode potentials of all other electrodes.

#### Construction of the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)

- The SHE consists of a **platinum electrode** coated with fine platinum black, which is immersed in a **1 M H⁺** solution (acidic solution) at a temperature of **25°C (298 K)**.
- **Hydrogen gas** is bubbled over the electrode at a pressure of **1 atm**.
- The potential of the SHE is assigned as **0 V** by convention, and it is used to measure and compare the potentials of other electrodes.

#### Working Principle

The SHE is based on the half-reaction:
$$
2H^+ + 2e^- \rightleftharpoons H_2 \quad (E^\circ = 0 \, V)
$$
This reaction represents the equilibrium between hydrogen ions and hydrogen gas, where the platinum electrode facilitates the exchange of electrons.

#### Importance

- The SHE provides a reference for the measurement of other electrode potentials.
- It helps in calculating the cell potential of an electrochemical cell by comparing the potentials of two half-cells.

### Calomel Electrode

The **Calomel Electrode** is another commonly used reference electrode in electrochemical measurements. It consists of a mercury/mercury chloride (Hg/Hg₂Cl₂) combination in contact with a chloride solution. It is a reliable electrode used for measuring pH and in various electrochemical applications.

#### Construction of the Calomel Electrode

- The Calomel electrode consists of a **mercury (Hg)** electrode in contact with a **saturated solution of potassium chloride (KCl)**, where the mercury is in contact with **mercury chloride (Hg₂Cl₂)**, also known as **calomel**.
- The mercury chloride forms a paste, and the potential of the calomel electrode depends on the concentration of chloride ions in the solution.

#### Working Principle

The half-reaction for the Calomel electrode is:
$$
Hg_2Cl_2 + 2e^- \rightleftharpoons 2Hg + 2Cl^- \quad (E^\circ = +0.241 \, V \, \text{at} \, 25^\circ C)
$$
The electrode potential of the Calomel electrode is dependent on the concentration of **Cl⁻** ions in the solution. A saturated KCl solution (approximately 3.5 M) is typically used.

#### Importance

- The Calomel electrode is used as a reference electrode in potentiometric measurements, such as in the determination of pH and the measurement of various ion concentrations.
- It provides a stable and reproducible reference potential, making it essential in many laboratory experiments.

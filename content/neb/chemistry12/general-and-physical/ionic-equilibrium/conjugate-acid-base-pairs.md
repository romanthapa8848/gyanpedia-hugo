# Conjugate Acid–Base Pairs
In acid-base chemistry, the concept of conjugate acid-base pairs is crucial in understanding how acids and bases interact in solution. According to the Brønsted-Lowry definition:
- An **acid** is a substance that **donates a proton ($H^+$)**.
- A **base** is a substance that **accepts a proton ($H^+$)**.

When an acid donates a proton, it forms its **conjugate base**, and when a base accepts a proton, it forms its **conjugate acid**.

For example:
- The conjugate base of $HCl$ (hydrochloric acid) is $Cl^-$ (chloride ion), as $HCl$ donates a proton:
  $$
  HCl \rightarrow H^+ + Cl^-
  $$

- The conjugate acid of $NH_3$ (ammonia) is $NH_4^+$ (ammonium ion), as $NH_3$ accepts a proton:
  $$
  NH_3 + H^+ \rightarrow NH_4^+
  $$

In any acid-base reaction, the acid and its conjugate base are related by the proton transfer, and the base and its conjugate acid are similarly related. Conjugate acid-base pairs are always connected by a difference of one proton.

The strength of an acid or a base is linked to the strength of its conjugate. Strong acids have weak conjugate bases, while weak acids have stronger conjugate bases. Similarly, strong bases have weak conjugate acids, and weak bases have stronger conjugate acids.

## Summary
Conjugate acid-base pairs are formed when an acid donates a proton and a base accepts a proton. The strength of an acid or base influences the strength of its conjugate pair, with strong acids having weak conjugate bases, and strong bases having weak conjugate acids. Understanding conjugate pairs is fundamental to acid-base reactions and equilibria.

## FAQs

### 1. What is a conjugate acid-base pair?
A conjugate acid-base pair consists of two substances that differ by only one proton ($H^+$), where one is an acid (proton donor) and the other is a base (proton acceptor).

### 2. What is the conjugate base of $HCl$?
The conjugate base of $HCl$ is $Cl^-$, as $HCl$ donates a proton to form $Cl^-$.

### 3. What is the conjugate acid of $NH_3$?
The conjugate acid of $NH_3$ is $NH_4^+$, as $NH_3$ accepts a proton to form $NH_4^+$.

### 4. How are conjugate acid-base pairs related?
Conjugate acid-base pairs differ by exactly one proton. The acid in the pair donates a proton, while the base accepts it.

### 5. What happens when an acid donates a proton?
When an acid donates a proton, it forms its conjugate base, which has one less proton than the acid.

### 6. What happens when a base accepts a proton?
When a base accepts a proton, it forms its conjugate acid, which has one more proton than the base.

### 7. Are conjugate acids and bases always related?
Yes, conjugate acids and bases are always related by the transfer of a single proton in an acid-base reaction.

### 8. What is the conjugate base of $H_2O$?
The conjugate base of $H_2O$ (water) is $OH^-$ (hydroxide ion), as $H_2O$ can donate a proton to form $OH^-$.

### 9. Why are conjugate bases of strong acids weak?
Conjugate bases of strong acids are weak because the acid dissociates completely, leaving the conjugate base with little tendency to accept a proton and thus remain weak.

### 10. Why are conjugate acids of strong bases weak?
Conjugate acids of strong bases are weak because the base readily accepts protons, and its conjugate acid has little tendency to donate a proton.

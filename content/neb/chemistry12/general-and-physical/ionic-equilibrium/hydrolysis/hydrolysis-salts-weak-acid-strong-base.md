# Salts of Weak Acid and Strong Base (Solving Related Numerical Problems)

When a weak acid reacts with a strong base, a **basic salt** is formed. These salts partially hydrolyze in water, causing the solution to be slightly basic (pH > 7). Examples include sodium acetate ($\text{CH}_3\text{COONa}$) and potassium carbonate ($\text{K}_2\text{CO}_3$). Unlike neutral salts, these salts affect the $\text{OH}^-$ ion concentration due to hydrolysis, and understanding their behavior is crucial in calculating pH and solving related chemistry problems.

### Properties of Salts of Weak Acid and Strong Base

1. **Basic Nature of Solution**: The anion of a weak acid salt, such as $\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-$, reacts with water in a process called hydrolysis. This reaction produces $\text{OH}^-$ ions, making the solution basic:
   $$
   \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-
   $$

2. **Partial Hydrolysis**: Since the conjugate base of a weak acid is relatively strong, it partially reacts with water. This hydrolysis produces hydroxide ions, raising the pH above 7.

3. **Calculating pH**: For these salts, the pH depends on the degree of hydrolysis, which can be calculated using the salt’s dissociation constant ($K_b$) and the concentration of the salt in solution.

4. **Applications and Importance**: Understanding the behavior of salts of weak acids and strong bases is essential in buffer solutions, industrial chemistry, and environmental chemistry. These principles are crucial for applications that require controlling pH.

## Summary

Salts of weak acids and strong bases, such as sodium acetate and potassium carbonate, dissolve in water to produce basic solutions. The basicity is due to the hydrolysis of the anion, which releases $\text{OH}^-$ ions into the solution. This behavior is essential for understanding various chemical reactions, especially those related to pH regulation in buffer solutions.

## FAQs

### 1. What is a salt of a weak acid and strong base?

A salt formed by the reaction of a weak acid with a strong base results in a basic salt, which partially hydrolyzes in water to form a basic solution.

### 2. Why do these salts create a basic solution?

The anion from the weak acid reacts with water, producing $\text{OH}^-$ ions, which raises the solution's pH above 7.

### 3. How can you calculate the pH of a solution of sodium acetate?

The pH can be calculated using the hydrolysis constant ($K_b$) of the acetate ion and the concentration of the salt.

### 4. Why does hydrolysis occur in these salts?

Hydrolysis occurs because the anion from the weak acid is relatively strong and can react with water, forming $\text{OH}^-$ ions.

### 5. What role does hydrolysis play in buffer solutions?

Hydrolysis of weak acid salts can be used to create buffer solutions that resist changes in pH, as they can neutralize small amounts of added acid or base.

### 6. Does the concentration of the salt affect the pH?

Yes, the concentration of the salt affects the extent of hydrolysis, influencing the pH of the solution.

### 7. Can temperature influence the hydrolysis of these salts?

Yes, temperature changes can affect the degree of hydrolysis and, consequently, the pH of the solution.

### 8. How does $\text{CH}_3\text{COONa}$ behave in water?

$\text{CH}_3\text{COONa}$ dissociates into $\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-$ and $\text{Na}^+$, and the $\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-$ undergoes hydrolysis to produce a basic solution.

### 9. Why is sodium acetate used in buffers?

Sodium acetate provides the acetate ion, which can neutralize added $\text{H}^+$ ions, stabilizing the pH in buffer solutions.

### 10. How does the $K_b$ value affect the pH of a weak acid salt?

A higher $K_b$ for the anion means more $\text{OH}^-$ ions are produced, resulting in a higher pH.

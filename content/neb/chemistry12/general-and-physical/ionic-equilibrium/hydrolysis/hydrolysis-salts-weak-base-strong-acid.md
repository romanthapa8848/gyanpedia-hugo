# Salts of Weak Base and Strong Acid (Solving Related Numerical Problems)

Salts formed from weak bases and strong acids are **acidic salts**. These salts undergo hydrolysis in water, resulting in an acidic solution with a pH below 7. Common examples include ammonium chloride ($\text{NH}_4\text{Cl}$) and ammonium sulfate ($\text{(NH}_4)_2\text{SO}_4$). These salts dissociate in water, and the cation from the weak base undergoes hydrolysis, producing $\text{H}^+$ ions, which makes the solution acidic.

### Properties of Salts of Weak Base and Strong Acid

1. **Acidic Nature of Solution**: The cation of the weak base, such as $\text{NH}_4^+$, reacts with water in a hydrolysis reaction, forming $\text{H}^+$ ions:
   $$
   \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{NH}_3 + \text{H}^+
   $$

2. **Partial Hydrolysis**: The cation of a weak base partially hydrolyzes in water, increasing the concentration of $\text{H}^+$ ions and lowering the pH below 7.

3. **Calculating pH**: The pH of these solutions can be calculated by determining the extent of hydrolysis using the hydrolysis constant ($K_a$) of the cation and the salt's concentration.

4. **Applications and Importance**: Knowledge of acidic salts is important for understanding acid-base reactions, pH adjustments in solutions, and various industrial and environmental applications.

## Summary

Salts of weak bases and strong acids, such as ammonium chloride and ammonium sulfate, dissolve in water to produce acidic solutions. The acidic behavior results from the hydrolysis of the cation, which generates $\text{H}^+$ ions. Understanding these properties is essential in chemistry for applications that require acidic environments and pH control.

## FAQs

### 1. What is a salt of a weak base and strong acid?

A salt formed by the reaction of a weak base with a strong acid, resulting in an acidic solution due to the partial hydrolysis of the cation.

### 2. Why do these salts create an acidic solution?

The cation from the weak base undergoes hydrolysis, producing $\text{H}^+$ ions and lowering the pH of the solution.

### 3. How can you calculate the pH of an ammonium chloride solution?

The pH can be calculated by determining the hydrolysis constant ($K_a$) of the ammonium ion and using the concentration of the salt.

### 4. Why does hydrolysis occur in these salts?

Hydrolysis occurs because the cation of the weak base is strong enough to react with water, producing $\text{H}^+$ ions.

### 5. How is ammonium chloride used in pH control?

Ammonium chloride is used in various applications to create acidic conditions, as it hydrolyzes to produce $\text{H}^+$ ions in solution.

### 6. Does the concentration of the salt affect the pH?

Yes, the concentration affects the extent of hydrolysis, influencing the solution's pH.

### 7. Can temperature affect the hydrolysis of acidic salts?

Yes, temperature changes can alter the degree of hydrolysis and impact the solution's pH.

### 8. How does $\text{NH}_4\text{Cl}$ behave in water?

$\text{NH}_4\text{Cl}$ dissociates into $\text{NH}_4^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$, with $\text{NH}_4^+$ undergoing hydrolysis to form an acidic solution.

### 9. What is the role of $\text{NH}_4\text{Cl}$ in buffer solutions?

In buffer solutions, $\text{NH}_4\text{Cl}$ can help maintain a stable pH by supplying $\text{NH}_4^+$ ions that resist pH changes.

### 10. Why is the $K_a$ value important in determining the pH of weak base salts?

A higher $K_a$ for the cation means more $\text{H}^+$ ions are produced, resulting in a lower pH.

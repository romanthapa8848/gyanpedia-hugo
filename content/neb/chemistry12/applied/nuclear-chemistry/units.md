# Units of Radioactivity

Radioactivity is measured using specific units to quantify the amount of radiation emitted from a substance over time. The measurement of radioactivity is crucial in understanding the intensity of radioactive decay and ensuring safety in environments where radioactive materials are present. The most commonly used units of radioactivity are the Becquerel (Bq) and Curie (Ci).

## The Becquerel (Bq)

The Becquerel (Bq) is the SI (International System of Units) unit of radioactivity. It is defined as the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per second.

### Key Features:
- **Definition**: 1 Bq = 1 decay per second.
- **Use**: The Becquerel is commonly used in scientific research and is the standard unit in most countries for measuring the activity of radioactive substances.
- **Application**: The Becquerel is used to measure the rate of decay in a wide range of materials, including in medical applications, environmental monitoring, and nuclear power generation.

## The Curie (Ci)

The Curie (Ci) is an older unit of radioactivity that was widely used before the Becquerel became the standard. It is still used in some countries, particularly in the United States.

### Key Features:
- **Definition**: 1 Ci = 3.7 × 10¹⁰ decays per second.
- **Historical Context**: The Curie was named after Marie and Pierre Curie, who pioneered research on radioactivity.
- **Conversion**: To convert from Curie to Becquerel, you can use the following relation:
  
  $$ 1 \, \text{Ci} = 3.7 \times 10^{10} \, \text{Bq} $$

- **Use**: Though less commonly used today, the Curie is still employed in some areas such as the measurement of radioactive sources in nuclear medicine and industrial radiography.

## Other Units of Measurement

### Gray (Gy) and Sievert (Sv)
While the Becquerel and Curie measure the activity of a radioactive material, the Gray (Gy) and Sievert (Sv) are used to measure the biological effects of radiation exposure.

- **Gray (Gy)**: A unit of absorbed dose. 1 Gy = 1 joule per kilogram of tissue.
- **Sievert (Sv)**: A unit that accounts for the biological effects of radiation, taking into account the type of radiation and the sensitivity of different tissues.

## Summary

The units of radioactivity, including Becquerel (Bq) and Curie (Ci), are essential for measuring the rate of radioactive decay in materials. The Becquerel is the modern SI unit, while the Curie is an older unit that is still used in some regions. These units help quantify the intensity of radiation emissions and ensure proper handling and safety in environments where radioactive substances are present.

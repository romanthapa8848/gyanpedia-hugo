# Elastomers and Fibres

Elastomers and fibres are two important classes of polymers that play vital roles in modern industries. Elastomers are known for their rubber-like properties, while fibres are long, flexible polymers used primarily for making textiles. Both are created through different polymerization methods and have distinct physical properties that make them suitable for specific applications.

## Elastomers

Elastomers are polymers with the ability to stretch significantly and return to their original shape once the stress is removed. This elastic property is a result of the long polymer chains being cross-linked, which allows the material to "bounce back" when stretched. The most common elastomer is rubber, which can be natural or synthetic.

### Examples:
- **Natural Rubber (Polyisoprene)**: Obtained from the sap of the rubber tree, natural rubber has excellent elasticity and is widely used in tires, footwear, and medical devices.
- **Synthetic Rubber**: Made through polymerization of monomers like butadiene and styrene, synthetic rubbers are used in a variety of applications, including tires and gaskets.

### Vulcanization of Rubber:
Vulcanization is the process of heating rubber with sulfur to create cross-links between the polymer chains. This process enhances the strength, elasticity, and durability of rubber.

## Fibres

Fibres are long, thread-like polymers that are spun into threads and woven into fabrics. These can be natural or synthetic, and they are primarily used for textile production, ropes, and other materials that require flexibility and strength.

### Types of Fibres:
1. **Natural Fibres**: These include cotton, wool, and silk, derived from plants or animals.
2. **Synthetic Fibres**: These are man-made fibres produced through polymerization processes. Common synthetic fibres include:
   - **Nylon (Polyamide)**: A strong, durable synthetic fibre used in clothing, carpets, and ropes.
   - **Terylene (Polyester)**: A synthetic fibre known for its durability, used in clothing and home furnishings.

## Summary

Elastomers are polymers with excellent stretchability and flexibility, primarily used in rubber products. Fibres, both natural and synthetic, are long polymer chains used in textile production and other applications that require strength and durability. Vulcanization of elastomers enhances their properties, while synthetic fibres like nylon and terylene have revolutionized the textile industry.

## FAQs

### 1. What is an elastomer?

An elastomer is a polymer that exhibits rubber-like elasticity, capable of stretching and returning to its original shape when stress is removed.

### 2. What is vulcanization?

Vulcanization is a chemical process in which rubber is treated with sulfur to form cross-links between polymer chains, improving its strength and elasticity.

### 3. What is the primary use of elastomers?

Elastomers are mainly used in products like rubber tires, footwear, gaskets, and medical devices due to their stretchable and flexible nature.

### 4. How are synthetic rubbers made?

Synthetic rubbers are made through the polymerization of monomers such as butadiene and styrene, often with the aid of catalysts.

### 5. What are natural fibres made from?

Natural fibres are made from plant sources like cotton and linen, or animal sources like wool and silk.

### 6. What is the difference between natural and synthetic fibres?

Natural fibres come from plants or animals, while synthetic fibres are man-made through chemical processes, such as polymerization.

### 7. What are the advantages of synthetic fibres?

Synthetic fibres like nylon and polyester are durable, lightweight, and resistant to wrinkles, making them ideal for clothing and industrial applications.

### 8. What is nylon used for?

Nylon is used in textiles, clothing, ropes, and carpets due to its strength, durability, and resistance to wear and tear.

### 9. What is Terylene made from?

Terylene is made from the polymerization of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, and it is used in textiles and other materials that require durability.

### 10. Can elastomers be recycled?

Some elastomers, such as synthetic rubbers, can be recycled, although the process is more complicated than recycling thermoplastics.

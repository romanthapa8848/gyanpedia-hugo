# Computation of Cross Exchange Rate

A **cross exchange rate** refers to the exchange rate between two currencies, computed by using a third currency, often the U.S. Dollar (USD), as a reference. Cross exchange rates are useful when there is no direct exchange rate available between two currencies. This concept is essential in international finance, where businesses and financial institutions need to convert currencies that don't have direct exchange rates.

## **Understanding Cross Exchange Rate Calculation**

The computation of a cross exchange rate involves using the exchange rates of the two currencies with a common reference currency, typically the U.S. Dollar (USD). The formula for calculating a cross exchange rate is as follows:

$$
\text{Cross Rate (Currency A/Currency B)} = \frac{\text{Exchange Rate (Currency A/USD)}}{\text{Exchange Rate (Currency B/USD)}}
$$

Where:

- **Currency A/USD** is the exchange rate of Currency A in terms of the USD.
- **Currency B/USD** is the exchange rate of Currency B in terms of the USD.

## **Example 1: Calculation of Cross Rate**

Let's assume we want to calculate the cross exchange rate between the British Pound (GBP) and the Japanese Yen (JPY) using the U.S. Dollar (USD) as the reference currency. Here are the exchange rates:

- 1 USD = 0.75 GBP
- 1 USD = 110 JPY

To calculate the GBP/JPY cross rate:

$$
\text{GBP/JPY} = \frac{\text{1 USD/0.75 GBP}}{\text{1 USD/110 JPY}} = \frac{110}{0.75} = 146.67
$$

So, the cross exchange rate between GBP and JPY is **146.67 JPY per GBP**.

## **Example 2: Using the Cross Rate to Convert Currencies**

If a business wants to convert 500 British Pounds (GBP) to Japanese Yen (JPY), we can use the cross rate we just calculated.

Given that the exchange rate between GBP and JPY is 146.67, the conversion would be:

$$
500 \, \text{GBP} \times 146.67 \, \text{JPY/GBP} = 73,335 \, \text{JPY}
$$

So, 500 British Pounds are equivalent to 73,335 Japanese Yen.

## Summary

Cross exchange rates are used to compute the exchange rate between two currencies by using a third currency, typically the U.S. Dollar, as a reference. The calculation is simple, involving division of two exchange rates. Cross rates are useful when there is no direct exchange rate available between the two currencies in question.

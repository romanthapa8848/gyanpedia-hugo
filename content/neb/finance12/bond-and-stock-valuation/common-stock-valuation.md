# Common Stock Valuation: Single Holding Periods, Multiple Holding Periods

Common stock valuation involves determining the value of a company’s shares based on the present value of future cash flows, such as dividends and capital gains. Stock valuation can be approached using different methods, depending on the number of holding periods considered. The two main methods of valuation are **single holding period** and **multiple holding periods**. Each method offers a different perspective on how investors value stock over time.

## **Single Holding Period Valuation**

In the single holding period valuation method, the value of a stock is determined based on the expected price and dividends that will be received over a single holding period (e.g., one year). This method is most appropriate for short-term investors or those who plan to sell the stock after a single period.

### **Formula for Single Holding Period Valuation**

The formula to calculate the value of common stock for a single holding period is:

$$
P_0 = \frac{D_1 + P_1}{(1 + r)}
$$

Where:

- $P_0$ = Price of the stock today (current stock price)
- $D_1$ = Expected dividend in the next period
- $P_1$ = Expected stock price at the end of the period
- $r$ = Required rate of return (discount rate)

In this approach, the stock’s value is based on the expected dividend payment and the expected future price of the stock.

## **Multiple Holding Periods Valuation**

For long-term investors who plan to hold the stock for several periods, the multiple holding periods valuation method is more appropriate. In this method, the value of the stock is determined by considering the dividends and expected price changes over multiple periods, using the concept of discounted cash flows for each period.

### **Formula for Multiple Holding Periods Valuation**

The formula to calculate the value of a stock for multiple holding periods is:

$$
P_0 = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{D_t}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{P_n}{(1 + r)^n}
$$

Where:

- $P_0$ = Price of the stock today (current stock price)
- $D_t$ = Expected dividend in period $t$
- $P_n$ = Expected stock price at the end of the final period $n$
- $r$ = Required rate of return (discount rate)
- $n$ = Number of periods

In this method, the stock’s value is calculated as the sum of the present values of dividends for each period, plus the present value of the expected sale price at the end of the holding period.

## **Key Differences Between Single and Multiple Holding Periods Valuation**

1. **Time Frame**:

   - **Single Holding Period**: Considers a one-period holding, useful for short-term investments.
   - **Multiple Holding Periods**: Considers several periods, useful for long-term investors.

2. **Cash Flows Considered**:

   - **Single Holding Period**: Only includes one dividend and one expected price.
   - **Multiple Holding Periods**: Includes multiple dividends and an expected price at the end of each period.

3. **Investor Perspective**:
   - **Single Holding Period**: Suitable for those who are looking to sell the stock after a short duration.
   - **Multiple Holding Periods**: Suitable for long-term investors who expect to hold the stock for an extended period.

## Summary

Common stock valuation methods, namely **single holding period** and **multiple holding periods**, allow investors to determine the value of a stock by considering expected future dividends and prices. The single holding period method is useful for short-term investors, while the multiple holding periods method is more appropriate for long-term investors. Both methods rely on the time value of money and require determining the expected cash flows and the required rate of return.

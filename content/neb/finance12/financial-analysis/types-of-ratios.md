# Types of Ratios

In financial analysis, ratios are used to assess the financial health and performance of a company. Ratios provide insights into various aspects of a business, such as profitability, liquidity, efficiency, and solvency. These ratios are essential tools for investors, creditors, and management to make informed decisions. The key types of financial ratios include:

---

## 1. **Liquidity Ratios**

Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. These ratios help assess the financial stability and the ability of a company to cover its current liabilities with its current assets.

### Common Liquidity Ratios:

- **Current Ratio:**

  - Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities
  - Purpose: Measures whether the company has enough short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities.
  - Ideal Value: A current ratio of 2:1 is generally considered healthy.

- **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**

  - Formula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
  - Purpose: A more stringent measure of liquidity that excludes inventory from current assets since inventory might not be quickly converted to cash.

- **Cash Ratio:**
  - Formula: Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities
  - Purpose: Measures the ability of a company to cover its short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets, cash.

## 2. **Profitability Ratios**

Profitability ratios evaluate a company's ability to generate earnings compared to its expenses over a certain period. These ratios help assess how well the company is performing in generating profits.

### Common Profitability Ratios:

- **Gross Profit Margin:**

  - Formula: (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue
  - Purpose: Indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold. A higher ratio suggests better profitability.

- **Operating Profit Margin:**

  - Formula: Operating Profit / Revenue
  - Purpose: Measures the percentage of revenue remaining after paying for variable costs of production, such as wages and raw materials.

- **Net Profit Margin:**

  - Formula: Net Profit / Revenue
  - Purpose: Shows how much profit a company makes for every dollar of revenue after all expenses, taxes, and costs are deducted.

- **Return on Assets (ROA):**

  - Formula: Net Income / Average Total Assets
  - Purpose: Measures how effectively the company is using its assets to generate profit.

- **Return on Equity (ROE):**
  - Formula: Net Income / Shareholder’s Equity
  - Purpose: Indicates how efficiently the company is using shareholders' equity to generate profit.

## 3. **Leverage Ratios (Solvency Ratios)**

Leverage ratios are used to evaluate a company's long-term solvency and ability to meet long-term obligations. These ratios assess the financial structure of the company, particularly the proportion of debt used to finance assets.

### Common Leverage Ratios:

- **Debt to Equity Ratio:**

  - Formula: Total Debt / Shareholders’ Equity
  - Purpose: Measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance the company’s assets.

- **Debt Ratio:**

  - Formula: Total Debt / Total Assets
  - Purpose: Indicates the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed through debt.

- **Interest Coverage Ratio:**
  - Formula: Operating Profit (EBIT) / Interest Expense
  - Purpose: Measures a company’s ability to meet its interest obligations from its operating income. A higher ratio suggests a stronger ability to pay interest.

## 4. **Efficiency Ratios (Activity Ratios)**

Efficiency ratios, also known as activity ratios, assess how well a company utilizes its assets to generate revenue. These ratios help in determining how effectively a business is managing its resources.

### Common Efficiency Ratios:

- **Inventory Turnover Ratio:**

  - Formula: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
  - Purpose: Measures how quickly a company sells and replaces its inventory. A higher ratio indicates efficient inventory management.

- **Receivables Turnover Ratio:**

  - Formula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable
  - Purpose: Indicates how effectively a company collects revenue from its credit sales. A higher ratio suggests efficient collection practices.

- **Asset Turnover Ratio:**
  - Formula: Revenue / Average Total Assets
  - Purpose: Measures the efficiency of a company in generating sales from its assets. A higher ratio indicates better asset utilization.

## 5. **Market Ratios**

Market ratios are used to evaluate the performance of a company’s stock and its attractiveness to investors. These ratios help investors assess the value of a company relative to its stock price.

### Common Market Ratios:

- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):**

  - Formula: Net Income / Outstanding Shares
  - Purpose: Measures the portion of a company’s profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock.

- **Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio):**

  - Formula: Market Price Per Share / Earnings Per Share
  - Purpose: Indicates the market’s valuation of a company’s earnings. A higher P/E ratio often suggests that the market expects future growth.

- **Dividend Yield:**
  - Formula: Annual Dividends Per Share / Market Price Per Share
  - Purpose: Measures the return on investment from dividends alone. A higher dividend yield suggests a higher income from dividends.

---

## 6. **Coverage Ratios**

Coverage ratios are used to measure the company's ability to meet its debt obligations, particularly interest payments.

### Common Coverage Ratios:

- **Times Interest Earned (TIE) Ratio:**

  - Formula: EBIT / Interest Expense
  - Purpose: Indicates how easily a company can pay interest on its outstanding debt. A higher ratio suggests a lower risk of default.

- **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR):**
  - Formula: Net Operating Income / Debt Obligations
  - Purpose: Measures a company's ability to cover its debt payments with its net operating income. A DSCR of less than 1 indicates a potential risk of insolvency.

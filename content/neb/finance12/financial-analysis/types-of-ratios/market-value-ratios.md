# Market Value Ratios: Price-Earnings Ratio, Market to Book Ratio

Market value ratios are important financial metrics used to evaluate a company's market performance and its value in the eyes of investors. These ratios help determine how the market values the company in relation to its earnings, book value, and stock price. The primary market value ratios include the **Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio** and the **Market to Book Ratio**.

## 1. **Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**

The **Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio** is one of the most commonly used ratios for evaluating the valuation of a company’s stock. It compares the market price of a company's stock to its earnings per share (EPS), indicating how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.

### Formula:

$$
\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Earnings per Share (EPS)}}
$$

### Interpretation:

- A **high P/E ratio** suggests that investors expect high future growth in earnings, and the stock may be overvalued.
- A **low P/E ratio** indicates that the stock is undervalued, or the company may be experiencing difficulties.
- The P/E ratio varies by industry and should be compared to industry averages for better context.

### Example:

If the market price per share of a company is $50, and its earnings per share (EPS) is $5:

$$
\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{50}{5} = 10
$$

This means investors are willing to pay 10 times the earnings for each share of the company.

## 2. **Market to Book Ratio**

The **Market to Book Ratio** compares the market value of a company’s equity to its book value. This ratio provides insight into how the market values the company relative to its actual net asset value.

### Formula:

$$
\text{Market to Book Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Book Value per Share}}
$$

### Interpretation:

- A **Market to Book Ratio greater than 1** suggests that the market values the company higher than its book value, which may indicate future growth potential or intangible assets.
- A **ratio less than 1** suggests that the market is undervaluing the company or that it has negative growth prospects.
- A ratio of **1** indicates that the market and book value are the same.

### Example:

If the market price per share of a company is $60, and its book value per share is $40:

$$
\text{Market to Book Ratio} = \frac{60}{40} = 1.5
$$

This means that the market values the company at 1.5 times its book value.

## Summary

- The **Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio** evaluates how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company’s earnings.
- The **Market to Book Ratio** compares a company’s market value to its book value, helping investors assess its market valuation relative to its actual net asset value.

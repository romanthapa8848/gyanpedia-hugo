## Cash Management

### Concept of Cash Management

Cash management is the process of managing the company's cash flow to ensure that there is enough liquidity for day-to-day operations while minimizing idle cash. Effective cash management involves balancing inflows and outflows of cash to avoid both liquidity shortages and excess cash that could have been invested elsewhere.

### Importance of Cash Management

1. Liquidity: Ensures the company has enough cash to meet its short-term obligations like paying creditors and employees.
2. Investment Opportunities: Efficient cash management helps in making use of any surplus cash by investing in short-term assets that offer returns.
3. Cost Control: Proper cash management reduces the need for borrowing and helps minimize interest costs.
4. Financial Planning: Allows businesses to plan for future expenditures and avoid unnecessary borrowing.

### Cash Management Techniques

- **Cash Budgeting**: Forecasting cash inflows and outflows to plan for future cash needs.
- **Cash Flow Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring cash inflows and outflows to ensure sufficient liquidity.

## Receivables Management

### Concept of Receivables Management

Receivables management involves managing the amounts owed to the company by its customers for goods or services provided on credit. The goal is to ensure timely collection and minimize the risk of bad debts.

### Importance of Receivables Management

1. Improved Cash Flow: Faster collection of receivables improves the company’s liquidity and cash flow.
2. Reduced Bad Debts: Proper credit evaluation and monitoring can reduce the risk of non-payment.
3. Increased Profitability: Efficient receivables management ensures that the company receives payments on time, which helps to maintain or increase profitability.
4. Financial Stability: Timely collection improves the overall financial health and stability of the business.

### Receivables Management Techniques

- **Credit Policy**: Setting clear terms and conditions for credit sales to ensure customers can pay on time.

## Inventory Management

### Concept of Inventory Management

Inventory management involves overseeing and controlling a company's inventory, which includes raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. The goal is to ensure that there is enough inventory to meet customer demand while avoiding overstocking, which ties up capital.

### Importance of Inventory Management

1. Cost Control: Proper inventory management helps minimize storage costs and avoid waste.
2. Meeting Customer Demand: Ensures that sufficient inventory is available to meet customer orders without delays.
3. Cash Flow Management: Minimizes the amount of capital tied up in excess inventory, improving liquidity.
4. Operational Efficiency: Reduces the risk of stockouts and ensures smooth production and sales processes.

### Inventory Management Techniques

- **Just-in-Time (JIT)**: A method that minimizes inventory levels by ordering raw materials and components only when needed for production.
- **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**: A formula used to determine the optimal order size that minimizes total inventory costs.
- **ABC Analysis**: A method of categorizing inventory items based on their importance, allowing better control over high-value items.

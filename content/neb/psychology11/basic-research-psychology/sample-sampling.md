# Sample and Sampling: Meaning and Definition of Sample and Sampling, Types of Sampling – Random and Non-Random

Sampling is a process used in research to select a subset of individuals or items from a larger population. The goal is to gather data from a manageable group that can represent the characteristics of the larger population, making the research process efficient and feasible.

- **Sample**: A sample is a smaller group selected from the larger population for the purpose of research. It is meant to reflect the broader characteristics of the population, and data collected from the sample is used to make generalizations about the population.

- **Sampling**: Sampling is the process of selecting individuals or items from a larger population. This process is crucial in research as it allows researchers to conduct studies without having to include every member of the population.

### Types of Sampling

Sampling methods can be broadly classified into two categories: **random sampling** and **non-random sampling**.

#### 1. **Random Sampling**
Random sampling refers to a sampling technique where every individual or item in the population has an equal chance of being selected. This method minimizes bias and ensures that the sample is representative of the entire population.

**Key Types of Random Sampling**:
- **Simple Random Sampling**: Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
- **Systematic Sampling**: Selecting every nth individual from a list or population.
- **Stratified Sampling**: The population is divided into subgroups (strata), and random samples are taken from each subgroup.
- **Cluster Sampling**: The population is divided into clusters, and some clusters are selected at random for sampling.

#### 2. **Non-Random Sampling**
Non-random sampling, also known as **non-probability sampling**, involves selecting participants or items based on criteria other than random selection. This method may introduce bias but is often used when random sampling is not feasible.

**Key Types of Non-Random Sampling**:
- **Convenience Sampling**: Selecting participants who are easily accessible to the researcher.
- **Judgmental Sampling**: Selecting individuals based on the researcher’s judgment or criteria.
- **Quota Sampling**: Dividing the population into subgroups and selecting a fixed number from each group based on predetermined quotas.
- **Snowball Sampling**: One participant refers others who meet the research criteria, creating a chain of referrals.

## Summary

Sampling is a crucial aspect of research methodology, allowing researchers to make inferences about a larger population based on data collected from a smaller, manageable sample. Sampling can be categorized into random and non-random methods, with each method having its own advantages and limitations depending on the nature of the study.

## FAQs

### 1. What is a sample in research?  
A sample is a subset of individuals or items selected from a larger population for the purpose of research.

### 2. What is the purpose of sampling in research?  
Sampling helps researchers gather data from a manageable group that represents the larger population, saving time and resources.

### 3. What is random sampling?  
Random sampling is a technique where every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample.

### 4. What is the difference between random and non-random sampling?  
Random sampling ensures each member has an equal chance of being selected, while non-random sampling involves subjective selection criteria.

### 5. What is systematic sampling?  
Systematic sampling involves selecting every nth individual from a population list.

### 6. What is stratified sampling?  
Stratified sampling divides the population into subgroups and selects random samples from each subgroup to ensure representation across different categories.

### 7. What is convenience sampling?  
Convenience sampling involves selecting participants who are easily accessible to the researcher, often at the cost of generalizability.

### 8. What is quota sampling?  
Quota sampling involves selecting a fixed number of participants from specific subgroups within a population.

### 9. What is snowball sampling?  
Snowball sampling is a non-random technique where participants refer others who meet the research criteria, forming a chain of referrals.

### 10. What is judgmental sampling?  
Judgmental sampling is a method where the researcher selects participants based on their own judgment or specific criteria.

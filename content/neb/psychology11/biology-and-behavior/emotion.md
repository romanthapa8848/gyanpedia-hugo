# Emotion: Definition, Characteristics, Types: Positive and Negative

Emotions are complex psychological and physiological responses to stimuli that influence behavior, thoughts, and feelings. Emotions play a central role in human experiences, guiding our reactions to different situations, interactions, and challenges.

## 1. Definition of Emotion
Emotion is a state of mental and physiological arousal caused by an internal or external event. It is a response to stimuli, reflecting an individual’s feelings, moods, and experiences. Emotions can be positive (pleasurable) or negative (unpleasant), affecting how we interact with the world and others.

### Characteristics of Emotion:
- **Physiological Changes**: Emotions often cause changes in the body, such as increased heart rate, sweating, or changes in facial expressions.
- **Psychological Impact**: Emotions influence thoughts, perceptions, and attitudes, which can shape behavior.
- **Intensity and Duration**: Emotions can vary in intensity (mild to intense) and duration (short-lived or lasting).
- **Universal**: Many emotions are universally experienced across different cultures, such as happiness, sadness, fear, and anger.
- **Subjective Experience**: Emotions are personal and can be experienced differently by individuals in similar situations.

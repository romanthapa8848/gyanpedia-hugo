## The Motivation Cycle

The motivation cycle explains how motivation operates in a continuous process:

1. **Need**: An unmet requirement creates a state of imbalance (e.g., hunger).
2. **Drive**: The need generates a drive, which is the internal push to act (e.g., craving food).
3. **Action**: The individual takes steps to fulfill the need (e.g., eating).
4. **Goal Fulfillment**: Once the need is satisfied, balance is restored (e.g., no longer hungry).
5. **Feedback**: The cycle repeats when a new need arises.

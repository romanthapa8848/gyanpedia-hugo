# Thermal Equilibrium and Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

---

## Thermal Equilibrium

Thermal equilibrium is a state where two systems in thermal contact no longer exchange heat because they have reached the same temperature. This means that the systems are at the same thermal energy level, and there is no net flow of heat between them. When thermal equilibrium is achieved, both systems are said to be in equilibrium, and their temperatures are equal.

For example, if you place a hot object in contact with a cooler one, heat will transfer from the hotter object to the cooler one until both objects reach the same temperature. At this point, the system is in thermal equilibrium.

## Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that:

> **If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.**

This law essentially defines temperature. It allows us to measure temperature and provides a foundation for the concept of temperature scales. The Zeroth Law tells us that if system A is in equilibrium with system C, and system B is also in equilibrium with system C, then system A and system B must be in equilibrium with each other. This is crucial for the development of temperature measurement devices, like thermometers.

## Summary

- **Thermal Equilibrium** occurs when two systems in contact no longer exchange heat, as they have the same temperature.
- The **Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics** establishes that if two systems are each in equilibrium with a third system, they are in equilibrium with each other, leading to the concept of temperature.

## FAQs

**1. What is thermal equilibrium?**  
Thermal equilibrium occurs when two systems in contact have the same temperature and no heat flows between them.

**2. How is thermal equilibrium achieved?**  
It is achieved when the systems reach the same temperature, and there is no net transfer of heat.

**3. Why is the Zeroth Law important?**  
The Zeroth Law defines temperature and allows us to establish temperature scales and compare temperatures.

**4. Can thermal equilibrium happen without physical contact?**  
Yes, it can happen via radiation, as heat can transfer through electromagnetic waves without direct contact.

**5. How does the Zeroth Law relate to thermometers?**  
The Zeroth Law provides the foundation for temperature measurement. If a thermometer is in thermal equilibrium with a system, it gives the system's temperature.

**6. What is an example of thermal equilibrium?**  
An example is when a hot cup of coffee cools down and reaches the same temperature as the surrounding air, and no more heat flows.

**7. Does thermal equilibrium mean the systems are at rest?**  
No, the systems may still have molecular motion, but the average kinetic energy (temperature) of the particles in both systems is equal.

**8. How does the Zeroth Law apply to everyday life?**  
It allows us to compare the temperatures of different objects by bringing them into contact with a thermometer.

**9. Can the Zeroth Law be observed in practical scenarios?**  
Yes, it is observed every time we compare the temperatures of different objects using thermometers.

**10. How does the Zeroth Law help in defining temperature scales?**  
It enables the establishment of standard reference points, such as the freezing and boiling points of water, to create temperature scales like Celsius and Fahrenheit.

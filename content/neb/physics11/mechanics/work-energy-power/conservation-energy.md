# Conservation of Energy

The **Conservation of Energy** principle states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred from one form to another. In an isolated system, the total energy remains constant, though it may change between different forms, such as kinetic, potential, thermal, or other forms of energy.

## Law of Conservation of Energy

According to the law of conservation of energy, the total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time. This implies that:

$$
E_{\text{total}} = \text{Constant}
$$

Where:
- $E_{\text{total}}$ represents the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) in the system.

The mechanical energy of a system may be converted from one form to another, but the total amount of energy remains unchanged.

## Kinetic and Potential Energy

Energy in mechanical systems primarily exists in two forms:
1. **Kinetic Energy (KE)**: Energy due to motion, given by the formula:
   $$
   KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
   $$
   Where:
   - $m$ is the mass of the object (in kilograms, kg),
   - $v$ is the velocity of the object (in meters per second, m/s).

2. **Potential Energy (PE)**: Energy due to position or configuration, often gravitational potential energy, given by:
   $$
   PE = mgh
   $$
   Where:
   - $m$ is the mass of the object (in kilograms, kg),
   - $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity ($9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$ on Earth),
   - $h$ is the height of the object above the ground (in meters, m).

In a frictionless environment, when one form of energy (e.g., potential energy) decreases, it is converted into another form (e.g., kinetic energy), and vice versa.

## Energy Transformation

The principle of energy conservation is evident in various everyday examples. When an object falls freely under the influence of gravity, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as its height decreases:

- At the highest point (before falling), the object has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy.
- As the object falls, its potential energy decreases, and its kinetic energy increases.
- Just before it hits the ground, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is at its maximum.

Mathematically, this transformation is represented as:

$$
PE_{\text{initial}} = KE_{\text{final}}
$$

For an object of mass $m$ dropped from height $h$, with no air resistance:

$$
mgh = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
$$

Where:
- $h$ is the height from which the object is dropped,
- $v$ is the velocity just before impact.

## Work-Energy Principle and Energy Conservation

The work-energy principle can also be viewed as a consequence of energy conservation. The work done by the net force on an object results in a change in the object's kinetic energy. 

$$
W = \Delta KE
$$

Where:
- $W$ is the work done by the net force,
- $\Delta KE$ is the change in kinetic energy.

In the absence of external forces, the mechanical energy (sum of kinetic and potential energies) of a system remains constant. Thus, the total energy is conserved.

## Practical Applications of Conservation of Energy

1. **Pendulum**: In a simple pendulum, energy continuously transforms between potential and kinetic forms. At the highest point, the pendulum has maximum potential energy and minimum kinetic energy. At the lowest point, the potential energy is zero, and kinetic energy is maximum.

2. **Roller Coaster**: As a roller coaster climbs a hill, it gains potential energy. As it descends, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, making the roller coaster speed up.

3. **Collisions**: In elastic collisions, kinetic energy is conserved. For inelastic collisions, although kinetic energy is not conserved, the total energy (including internal energy and deformation) is still conserved.

---

## Summary

- **Conservation of Energy** states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted between forms.
- Energy in a system can be transformed between kinetic and potential energy, but the total energy remains constant in an isolated system.
- The principle is widely applied in various physical systems, including mechanical systems, pendulums, and roller coasters.
- Energy conservation is a fundamental concept in physics and plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of objects and systems.

## FAQs

**1. What is the principle of conservation of energy?**  
The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

**2. How is kinetic energy calculated?**  
Kinetic energy is given by $KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the object and $v$ is its velocity.

**3. What is potential energy?**  
Potential energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its position or configuration, calculated as $PE = mgh$.

**4. Is mechanical energy conserved in all situations?**  
Mechanical energy is conserved only in the absence of non-conservative forces like friction. In the presence of such forces, total energy is still conserved, but mechanical energy may not be.

**5. How does energy transformation occur in a falling object?**  
As an object falls, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The total mechanical energy (sum of potential and kinetic energy) remains constant if no external forces are involved.

**6. What is the formula for mechanical energy?**  
Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy: $E_{\text{mechanical}} = KE + PE$.

**7. Can energy be lost during energy transformation?**  
Energy cannot be lost; it can only be transferred or transformed. However, energy may be dissipated in non-mechanical forms (e.g., heat due to friction).

**8. How is the law of conservation of energy applied in roller coasters?**  
In a roller coaster, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as the coaster moves downhill. This transformation continues as the coaster ascends and descends, maintaining energy conservation.

**9. What happens to the potential and kinetic energy in a pendulum?**  
In a pendulum, the potential energy is maximum at the highest point, while kinetic energy is maximum at the lowest point. The total mechanical energy is conserved throughout the swing.

**10. What is the relationship between work and energy?**  
The work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy, as expressed by the work-energy theorem: $W = \Delta KE$.

# Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces

In physics, forces are classified based on how they affect the mechanical energy of a system. These forces are categorized into two types: **conservative forces** and **non-conservative forces**.

## Conservative Forces

A **conservative force** is one for which the work done by the force on an object moving between two points is independent of the path taken. The work done by a conservative force depends only on the initial and final positions of the object and not on the trajectory.

### Properties of Conservative Forces:
- The work done by the force on a moving object only depends on the initial and final positions.
- The work done over any closed path is zero. Mathematically:
  
  $$ 
  \oint \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} = 0 
  $$

- The potential energy can be associated with the force, and the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential energy) remains conserved in an isolated system where only conservative forces act.

### Examples of Conservative Forces:
1. **Gravitational Force**: The force exerted by the Earth on objects near its surface is a conservative force. The work done by gravity depends only on the initial and final heights of the object.
   
2. **Elastic (Spring) Force**: A spring follows Hooke's law, and the force it exerts is conservative. The work done by a spring depends only on the compression or elongation from its equilibrium position.

3. **Electrostatic Force**: The force between charged particles in an electric field is also conservative.

## Non-Conservative Forces

A **non-conservative force** is one for which the work done depends on the path taken. These forces cause energy to be dissipated in forms other than mechanical energy, such as heat, sound, or deformation. Unlike conservative forces, the work done by non-conservative forces does not have a potential energy associated with it.

### Properties of Non-Conservative Forces:
- The work done by the force depends on the path taken.
- The work done over a closed path is not zero.
- Non-conservative forces lead to a loss of mechanical energy from the system, converting it into other forms such as heat or sound.

### Examples of Non-Conservative Forces:
1. **Friction**: The force of friction between surfaces opposes motion and dissipates mechanical energy as heat. The work done by friction depends on the distance over which the force acts and is always negative.
   
2. **Air Resistance**: As an object moves through air, air resistance (drag) opposes the motion, converting some of the mechanical energy into heat and sound.
   
3. **Viscous Forces**: In fluids, viscous forces act to resist the motion of objects through the fluid, converting mechanical energy into internal energy.

## Work-Energy Theorem and Conservative Forces

For **conservative forces**, the work done is related to the change in potential energy. The total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) in a system is conserved when only conservative forces are acting. This is known as the **work-energy theorem**:

$$
\Delta K + \Delta U = W_{\text{total}}
$$

Where:
- $K$ is the kinetic energy,
- $U$ is the potential energy,
- $W_{\text{total}}$ is the work done by all forces.

Since conservative forces do not dissipate energy, the total mechanical energy remains constant.

## Work-Energy Theorem and Non-Conservative Forces

For **non-conservative forces**, the work done by these forces causes a change in the total mechanical energy of the system. When non-conservative forces are present, the total mechanical energy is no longer conserved; some of it is transformed into other forms of energy like heat. The work-energy theorem becomes:

$$
\Delta K + \Delta U = W_{\text{nc}}
$$

Where:
- $W_{\text{nc}}$ is the work done by the non-conservative forces, typically negative for forces like friction.

---

## Summary

- **Conservative Forces**: Work done depends only on the initial and final positions, and total mechanical energy is conserved in the absence of non-conservative forces.
- **Non-Conservative Forces**: Work done depends on the path, and energy is dissipated from the system (e.g., as heat or sound).
- The work-energy theorem applies to both conservative and non-conservative forces, but mechanical energy is only conserved in systems with only conservative forces.

## FAQs

**1. What is a conservative force?**  
A conservative force is one where the work done on an object depends only on its initial and final positions, and not on the path taken.

**2. Give an example of a conservative force.**

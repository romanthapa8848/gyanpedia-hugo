# Conservation of Linear Momentum

The principle of conservation of linear momentum is a fundamental law of physics that states that the total momentum of an isolated system remains constant if no external forces act on it.

---

## Statement

> In an isolated system (no external forces), the total linear momentum before and after an event (e.g., collision or explosion) remains constant.

### Mathematical Formulation

For a system of two objects:

$$
p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}}
$$

If $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses and $v_1$, $v_2$ are the velocities:

$$
m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = m_1 v_1' + m_2 v_2'
$$

Here, $v_1'$ and $v_2'$ are the velocities after the event.

## Derivation Using Newton's Third Law

1. Consider two objects with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ exerting forces on each other.
2. By Newton's third law: The force exerted by object 1 on object 2 ($F_{12}$) is equal and opposite to the force exerted by object 2 on object 1 ($F_{21}$):
   $$ 
   F_{12} = -F_{21} 
   $$
3. Using Newton's second law:
   $$
   F_{12} = \frac{\Delta p_1}{\Delta t}, \quad F_{21} = \frac{\Delta p_2}{\Delta t}
   $$
4. Substituting into the force equation:
   $$
   \frac{\Delta p_1}{\Delta t} = -\frac{\Delta p_2}{\Delta t}
   $$
5. Simplifying:
   $$
   \Delta p_1 + \Delta p_2 = 0
   $$
6. This implies:
   $$
   p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}}
   $$

## Applications of Conservation of Momentum

### 1. **Collisions**
   - **Elastic Collisions**: Momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.
   - **Inelastic Collisions**: Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not.

### 2. **Rocket Propulsion**
   - The backward momentum of exhaust gases equals the forward momentum of the rocket.

### 3. **Recoil of a Gun**
   - When a bullet is fired, the gun recoils to conserve momentum.

### 4. **Explosions**
   - The total momentum before and after the explosion remains constant.

---

## Summary

- Momentum is conserved in an isolated system.
- Conservation of momentum applies universally to collisions, explosions, and other interactions.

## FAQs

**1. What is the principle of conservation of linear momentum?**  
It states that in the absence of external forces, the total momentum of a system remains constant.

**2. Is momentum always conserved?**  
Yes, in an isolated system with no external forces, momentum is conserved.

**3. How does conservation of momentum apply to rocket propulsion?**  
The momentum of exhaust gases is equal and opposite to the momentum gained by the rocket.

**4. What is an elastic collision?**  
A collision in which both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.

**5. What happens to momentum in an explosion?**  
The total momentum before and after the explosion remains constant.

**6. Why is momentum conserved in a collision?**  
Because the forces involved are internal and cancel out, leaving the total momentum unchanged.

**7. What is the SI unit of momentum?**  
The SI unit is $\text{kg·m/s}$.

**8. Can an object have momentum if its velocity is zero?**  
No, because momentum depends on velocity: $p = mv$.

**9. Why does a gun recoil when firing a bullet?**  
To conserve momentum, the backward momentum of the gun equals the forward momentum of the bullet.

**10. Does conservation of momentum apply in non-isolated systems?**  
No, external forces can change the total momentum of the system.

# Motion of a Freely Falling Body

A freely falling body is an object that moves under the influence of gravity alone, without air resistance. The motion is uniformly accelerated, with the acceleration equal to the acceleration due to gravity, $g$. On Earth, $g \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$.

## Key Concepts

- **Initial Velocity ($u$):** If dropped from rest, $u = 0$.  
- **Acceleration ($a$):** $a = g$ for a freely falling body.  
- **Direction of Motion:**  
  - Downward motion is positive ($g = +9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$).  
  - Upward motion (against gravity) is negative ($g = -9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$).  

The equations of motion apply directly, with $a$ replaced by $g$.

## Equations of Motion for Freely Falling Bodies

1. **First Equation:**  
   $$ v = u + gt $$
   - $v$: Final velocity  
   - $t$: Time elapsed  

2. **Second Equation:**  
   $$ h = ut + \frac{1}{2}gt^2 $$
   - $h$: Height or distance fallen  

3. **Third Equation:**  
   $$ v^2 = u^2 + 2gh $$

These equations help calculate various parameters like velocity, height, or time for freely falling bodies.

## Examples

### Example 1: Calculating Final Velocity
A stone is dropped from rest from a height of $20 \, \text{m}$. Find its velocity just before hitting the ground.  
- Given: $u = 0$, $h = 20 \, \text{m}$, $g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$.  
- Using $v^2 = u^2 + 2gh$:  
  $$ v^2 = 0 + 2(9.8)(20) $$  
  $$ v = \sqrt{392} \approx 19.8 \, \text{m/s} $$  

### Example 2: Time of Free Fall
How long does it take for the stone in Example 1 to hit the ground?  
- Using $h = \frac{1}{2}gt^2$:  
  $$ 20 = \frac{1}{2}(9.8)t^2 $$  
  $$ t^2 = \frac{40}{9.8} \approx 4.08 $$  
  $$ t \approx 2.02 \, \text{seconds} $$

## FAQs

**1. What is a freely falling body?**  
A freely falling body is one that moves under the influence of gravity alone, without air resistance.

**2. What is the value of $g$ on Earth?**  
The value of $g$ is approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$.

**3. Can the equations of motion be used for free fall?**  
Yes, with $a$ replaced by $g$.

**4. What happens to the velocity of a freely falling body?**  
The velocity increases linearly with time due to constant acceleration.

**5. How is height calculated in free fall?**  
Height is calculated using $h = ut + \frac{1}{2}gt^2$.

**6. What is the initial velocity of a body dropped from rest?**  
If dropped from rest, the initial velocity is $0$.

**7. Can free fall occur in the absence of gravity?**  
No, free fall requires gravity.

**8. How is air resistance ignored in free fall?**  
In free fall, air resistance is assumed to be negligible, simplifying the motion to uniform acceleration.

**9. How does the mass of the object affect free fall?**  
The mass of the object does not affect free fall; all objects accelerate at the same rate under gravity.

**10. What happens to a body thrown upwards?**  
When thrown upwards, the body decelerates at $g$ until it comes to rest, then accelerates downward at $g$.

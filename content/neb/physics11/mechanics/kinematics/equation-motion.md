# Equation of Motion (Graphical Treatment)

The equations of motion describe the relationship between displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time in uniformly accelerated motion. Graphical treatment provides an intuitive understanding of these equations using velocity-time graphs.

---

## 1. First Equation of Motion: $v = u + at$

### Graphical Derivation
- Consider a velocity-time graph where:
  - Initial velocity = $u$ (at $t = 0$),
  - Final velocity = $v$ (at time $t$),
  - Acceleration = $a$.

The slope of the velocity-time graph represents acceleration:
$$
a = \frac{v - u}{t}
$$
Rearranging:
$$
v = u + at
$$

## 2. Second Equation of Motion: $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$

### Graphical Derivation
- The area under the velocity-time graph represents displacement ($s$).
- For a uniformly accelerated motion, the graph is a trapezium.

The total area of the trapezium:
$$
\text{Area} = \text{Area of rectangle} + \text{Area of triangle}
$$
$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}(v - u)t
$$
Substituting $v = u + at$:
$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$

## 3. Third Equation of Motion: $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$

### Graphical Derivation
- Using the velocity-time graph, the displacement ($s$) is given by:
$$
s = \frac{1}{2}(u + v)t
$$
From the first equation of motion, $t = \frac{v - u}{a}$. Substituting:
$$
s = \frac{1}{2}(u + v)\frac{v - u}{a}
$$
Simplify:
$$
2as = v^2 - u^2
$$
Rearranging:
$$
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
$$

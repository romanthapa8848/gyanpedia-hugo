# Escape Velocity  

**Escape velocity** is the minimum velocity required for an object to overcome a planet's gravitational pull and move away into space without falling back.

---

## Derivation of Escape Velocity  

The escape velocity is derived using the principle of energy conservation.  

### Concept  

For an object of mass $m$ to escape from the gravitational field of a planet of mass $M$, its total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) must be zero or greater.  

### Derivation  

1. **Kinetic Energy**: $K.E. = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$  
2. **Gravitational Potential Energy**: $P.E. = -\frac{GMm}{r}$  

At escape velocity, the total energy is zero:  

$$ \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r} = 0 $$  

Simplifying:  

$$ \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{GMm}{r} $$  

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}} $$  

where:  
- $v$ = escape velocity  
- $G$ = gravitational constant ($6.67 \times 10^{-11}$ N·m$^2$/kg$^2$)  
- $M$ = mass of the planet  
- $r$ = radius of the planet  

### Key Formula  

$$ v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}} $$  

For Earth:  
- $M = 5.972 \times 10^{24}$ kg  
- $R = 6.371 \times 10^6$ m  

$$ v_e \approx 11.2 \, \text{km/s} $$

## Key Points  

1. Escape velocity is independent of the object's mass.  
2. It depends only on the mass and radius of the planet.  
3. For a body to escape Earth's gravity, it must achieve a velocity of $11.2$ km/s.

## Applications of Escape Velocity  

1. **Space Exploration**: Rockets achieve escape velocity to leave Earth's atmosphere.  
2. **Astrophysics**: Helps in understanding the motion of celestial bodies.  
3. **Planetary Science**: Used to compare gravitational pulls of different planets.

## Summary  

- **Escape Velocity Formula**: $v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$  
- **Earth's Escape Velocity**: $11.2$ km/s  
- Escape velocity is crucial for launching satellites and space exploration.

## FAQs  

**1. What is escape velocity?**  
Escape velocity is the minimum velocity required for an object to escape a planet's gravitational field.  

**2. Does escape velocity depend on the object's mass?**  
No, escape velocity is independent of the object's mass.  

**3. What is the escape velocity on Earth?**  
The escape velocity on Earth is approximately $11.2$ km/s.  

**4. Why does the escape velocity depend on the planet's mass and radius?**  
Larger mass and smaller radius increase the gravitational pull, requiring higher escape velocity.  

**5. Can escape velocity be achieved on Earth's surface?**  
It is achieved by rockets with enough fuel and thrust, as atmospheric resistance is also a factor.  

**6. How is escape velocity different from orbital velocity?**  
Orbital velocity keeps an object in orbit, while escape velocity allows it to leave the gravitational field.  

**7. Does atmospheric resistance affect escape velocity?**  
The theoretical escape velocity ignores air resistance, but in practice, rockets must account for it.  

**8. What is the escape velocity of the Moon?**  
The Moon's escape velocity is approximately $2.4$ km/s due to its smaller mass and radius.  

**9. Is escape velocity the same for all objects on Earth?**  
Yes, as long as the object is at the same point in Earth's gravitational field.  

**10. How does escape velocity relate to black holes?**  
The escape velocity at a black hole's event horizon equals the speed of light, making escape impossible.

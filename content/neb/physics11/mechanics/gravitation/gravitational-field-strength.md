# Gravitational Field Strength

The gravitational field strength at a point is the gravitational force per unit mass experienced by an object placed at that point. It is a vector quantity that represents the intensity of the gravitational field.

---

## Definition

Gravitational field strength ($g$) is defined as:  
$$ g = \frac{F}{m} $$  

where:  
- $g$ = gravitational field strength (N/kg)  
- $F$ = gravitational force acting on a mass (N)  
- $m$ = mass of the object experiencing the force (kg)  

---

## Formula for Gravitational Field Strength

Using Newton's law of gravitation, the force between two masses $M$ (source mass) and $m$ (test mass) separated by a distance $r$ is:  
$$ F = G \frac{M m}{r^2} $$  

The gravitational field strength $g$ at a distance $r$ from the source mass $M$ is:  
$$ g = \frac{F}{m} = G \frac{M}{r^2} $$  

Here:  
- $G$ = universal gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$)  
- $M$ = mass of the source (kg)  
- $r$ = distance from the source mass to the point (m)  

---

## Key Points  

1. **Direction**: The direction of $g$ is towards the center of the source mass.  
2. **Units**: The SI unit of gravitational field strength is N/kg or m/s².  
3. **Variation with Distance**: $g$ decreases with the square of the distance from the source mass.

## Gravitational Field Strength on Earth  

At the surface of the Earth:  
$$ g = G \frac{M}{R^2} $$  

where:  
- $M$ = mass of Earth ($5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}$)  
- $R$ = radius of Earth ($6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}$)  

Substituting values:  
$$ g \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 $$

## Applications of Gravitational Field Strength  

1. **Weight Calculation**: Weight $W$ of an object is given by $W = mg$.  
2. **Orbit Dynamics**: Determines the gravitational force on satellites.  
3. **Planetary Studies**: Helps calculate the mass and size of planets.  
4. **Tides**: Explains the strength of the Moon’s gravitational pull on Earth.

## Summary  

Gravitational field strength quantifies the intensity of the gravitational field at a point. It decreases with distance from the source and is crucial for understanding gravitational interactions.

## FAQs  

**1. What is gravitational field strength?**  
It is the gravitational force per unit mass at a point in a gravitational field.

**2. What is the formula for $g$?**  
The formula is $g = G \frac{M}{r^2}$, where $M$ is the source mass, and $r$ is the distance from the source.  

**3. What is the unit of gravitational field strength?**  
The SI unit is N/kg or m/s².  

**4. What is the value of $g$ on Earth's surface?**  
It is approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$.  

**5. Does $g$ change with height?**  
Yes, $g$ decreases as height increases due to the inverse-square law.  

**6. Is $g$ a scalar or vector quantity?**  
It is a vector quantity, with its direction towards the source mass.  

**7. What factors affect $g$?**  
The mass of the source object and the distance from the source affect $g$.  

**8. How is $g$ related to weight?**  
Weight is the product of $g$ and mass, $W = mg$.  

**9. Can $g$ be zero?**  
$g$ is zero only at infinite distance from any mass or at the center of a symmetric mass distribution.  

**10. Why does $g$ vary on Earth’s surface?**  
It varies due to Earth's rotation and its non-uniform shape (oblate spheroid).

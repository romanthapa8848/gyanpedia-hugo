# Motion in a Vertical Circle

In the case of **motion in a vertical circle**, an object moves along a circular path under the influence of gravity and tension in the string (or any other force providing the centripetal force). The forces acting on the object in different parts of the circular path are crucial for understanding its motion.

## Forces Acting on an Object in a Vertical Circle

In vertical circular motion, there are two main forces acting on the object:
1. **Gravitational Force ($mg$)**: Acts vertically downward at all points.
2. **Tension ($T$)**: Acts along the direction of the string, which changes as the object moves along the circular path.

At different points in the vertical circle, the tension and gravitational force combine in different ways to provide the necessary centripetal force for circular motion.

## Key Concepts in Vertical Circular Motion

### 1. **Centripetal Force**
The centripetal force needed to keep the object moving in a circular path is provided by the combination of the tension in the string and the gravitational force. This force is always directed towards the center of the circle.

At any point in the vertical circle, the centripetal force is given by:
$$
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$
where $m$ is the mass of the object, $v$ is its velocity, and $r$ is the radius of the circle.

### 2. **Tension in the String**
The tension in the string varies at different points in the circular motion. It is maximum at the lowest point and minimum at the highest point of the vertical circle.

- **At the lowest point**: The tension ($T_{lowest}$) is given by:
  $$
  T_{lowest} = \frac{mv^2}{r} + mg
  $$
  The tension is the sum of the centripetal force and the gravitational force, as both are acting in the same direction.

- **At the highest point**: The tension ($T_{highest}$) is given by:
  $$
  T_{highest} = \frac{mv^2}{r} - mg
  $$ 
  At the highest point, the gravitational force acts in the same direction as the centripetal force, reducing the required tension.

### 3. **Condition for Circular Motion**
For an object to complete the circular motion, especially at the highest point, the tension in the string must be positive. This imposes a minimum speed condition at the highest point:
$$
v_{min} = \sqrt{gr}
$$
At this speed, the tension becomes zero at the highest point, but the object still moves in the circle under the influence of gravity.

### 4. **Speed of the Object at Various Points**
The speed of the object changes as it moves along the vertical circle due to the conservation of mechanical energy.

- **At the highest point**: The total energy is a combination of kinetic energy and potential energy:
  $$
  E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh
  $$

- **At the lowest point**: The total energy is purely kinetic as the potential energy is zero:
  $$
  E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
  $$

Using the conservation of mechanical energy, the speed at any point can be determined.

## Example of Motion in a Vertical Circle

Let us consider an object of mass $m = 2\ \text{kg}$ moving in a vertical circle with a radius of $r = 3\ \text{m}$. The object is moving at a speed of $v = 10\ \text{m/s}$ at the lowest point. To find the tension at the lowest point, we use the formula:

$$
T_{lowest} = \frac{mv^2}{r} + mg
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
T_{lowest} = \frac{2 \times 10^2}{3} + 2 \times 9.8 = \frac{200}{3} + 19.6 \approx 66.67 + 19.6 = 86.27\ \text{N}
$$

Thus, the tension at the lowest point is approximately $86.27\ \text{N}$.

## FAQs

**1. What is motion in a vertical circle?**  
Motion in a vertical circle refers to the movement of an object along a circular path in a vertical plane, under the influence of forces like gravity and tension.

**2. What forces are acting on an object in vertical circular motion?**  
The two main forces are the gravitational force ($mg$) acting downward and the tension ($T$) in the string, which acts along the string.

**3. How does the tension vary in vertical circular motion?**  
The tension is maximum at the lowest point of the circle and minimum at the highest point.

**4. What is the condition for an object to complete vertical circular motion?**  
For the object to complete the circular motion, the minimum speed at the highest point must be $v_{min} = \sqrt{gr}$, ensuring the tension does not become negative.

**5. How is centripetal force provided in vertical circular motion?**  
The centripetal force is provided by the combination of the tension in the string and the gravitational force.

**6. How does the speed of the object change in a vertical circle?**  
The speed of the object changes as it moves along the circle due to the conversion between kinetic and potential energy.

**7. What happens to the object if the speed at the highest point is less than $v_{min}$?**  
If the speed is less than $v_{min}$, the object will not be able to complete the circular motion and will fall from the highest point.

**8. What is the relationship between speed and radius in vertical circular motion?**  
The speed and radius are related through the condition for minimum speed at the highest point, $v_{min} = \sqrt{gr}$.

**9. Can an object complete a vertical circle with a constant speed?**  
No, the object’s speed changes as it moves along the vertical circle, due to the conservation of energy.

**10. How do we calculate the tension at the highest and lowest points?**  
At the lowest point, the tension is $T_{lowest} = \frac{mv^2}{r} + mg$, and at the highest point, the tension is $T_{highest} = \frac{mv^2}{r} - mg$.

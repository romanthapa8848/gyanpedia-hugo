# Dimensions and Uses of Dimensional Analysis

Dimensional analysis is a versatile method in physics that utilizes the relationship between physical quantities and their units to verify equations, derive formulas, and solve various problems.

## Dimensions

**Dimensions** describe a physical quantity in terms of the fundamental quantities (mass, length, time, etc.). These fundamental quantities have unique symbols used in dimensional formulas:

| Fundamental Quantity | Symbol | Unit (SI)         |
|-----------------------|--------|-------------------|
| Mass                 | M      | Kilogram (kg)     |
| Length               | L      | Meter (m)         |
| Time                 | T      | Second (s)        |
| Electric Current     | A      | Ampere (A)        |
| Temperature          | K      | Kelvin (K)        |
| Amount of Substance  | mol    | Mole (mol)        |
| Luminous Intensity   | cd     | Candela (cd)      |

The dimensional formula expresses a quantity in terms of these fundamental quantities.  

- **Example**: The dimensional formula for velocity is  
  $[V] = [L^1T^{-1}]$

### Rules of Dimensions

1. Dimensions of fundamental quantities are represented as powers of their symbols, e.g., $[M^aL^bT^c]$.
2. Dimensions are additive during multiplication and subtractive during division.

## Uses of Dimensional Analysis

Dimensional analysis is applied in several important ways:

### 1. **Checking Dimensional Consistency**
   - Ensures equations are dimensionally correct.
   - **Example**: For $v = u + at$,  
     - Dimensions of $v, u$: $[L^1T^{-1}]$  
     - Dimensions of $at$: $[L^1T^{-1}]$  
     - Both sides are dimensionally equal, verifying the equation.

### 2. **Deriving Relationships Between Quantities**
   - Helps derive formulas when one quantity depends on others.
   - **Example**: Deriving the time period ($T$) of a pendulum:  
     Assume $T$ depends on length $L$ and gravity $g$. Using dimensional analysis:  
     $$
     T \propto \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}  
     \Rightarrow T = k \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
     $$  
     (where $k$ is a constant).

### 3. **Unit Conversion**
   - Facilitates conversion between unit systems.
   - **Example**: To convert velocity from m/s to km/h:  
     $$
     1 \, \text{m/s} = 1 \times \frac{3600}{1000} \, \text{km/h} = 3.6 \, \text{km/h}
     $$

### 4. **Determining Dimensions of Constants**
   - Useful for finding the dimensional formula of constants.
   - **Example**: Gravitational constant $G$ in $F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$:  
     $$
     [G] = \frac{[F][r^2]}{[m_1m_2]} = [M^{-1}L^3T^{-2}]
     $$

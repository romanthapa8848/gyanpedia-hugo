# Non-Verbal Communication: Sitting Position, Open Posture, Leaning Forward, Eye Contact, Relaxed (SOLER)

The **SOLER** model is a framework used in non-verbal communication, especially in counseling, to help establish rapport and create an open, supportive environment. It stands for:

- **S**itting Position
- **O**pen Posture
- **L**eaning Forward
- **E**ye Contact
- **R**elaxed posture

These elements help improve communication between the counselor and client by using body language effectively.

### 1. Sitting Position
- **Face the client**: Ensure that your body is oriented towards the client to show full attention and respect.
- **Appropriate distance**: Keep a reasonable distance that respects the client’s personal space but is close enough to create connection.
- **Comfortable but engaged**: Sit comfortably without slouching, indicating that you are open and present in the conversation.
- **Avoid barriers**: Don’t sit behind a desk or any physical barrier that can create a sense of distance.

### 2. Open Posture
- **Uncrossed arms and legs**: This shows you are open, receptive, and ready to engage with the other person.
- **Body aligned toward the speaker**: Make sure your torso faces the person you are communicating with to show attentiveness.
- **No defensive gestures**: Avoid crossing arms or legs, which can be interpreted as a sign of defensiveness or discomfort.
- **Relaxed arms**: Keep your arms at your sides or on the table, signaling that you are engaged but not overbearing.

### 3. Leaning Forward
- **Indicates active listening**: Leaning forward slightly shows that you are focused and engaged in what the other person is saying.
- **Sign of empathy and interest**: It signals that you care about the conversation and are emotionally present.
- **Non-intrusive**: Leaning forward should be moderate—not too close as to invade personal space, but enough to show attentiveness.
- **Helps build rapport**: It creates a sense of connection, making the other person feel heard and valued.

### 4. Eye Contact
- **Shows attentiveness**: Maintaining appropriate eye contact demonstrates that you are actively listening and engaged in the conversation.
- **Builds trust**: Eye contact is essential for establishing trust and rapport, as it signals honesty and openness.
- **Don’t stare aggressively**: While eye contact is important, it should be natural and comfortable. Avoid staring as it can feel threatening.
- **Cultural considerations**: Be aware of cultural differences, as the meaning of eye contact may vary across cultures.

### 5. Relaxed
- **Calm and comfortable demeanor**: A relaxed posture and demeanor make the other person feel at ease and comfortable in the conversation.
- **Open and non-defensive**: Relaxed body language shows you are not guarded and encourages open communication.
- **Non-verbal reassurance**: A relaxed stance signals that you are approachable, not tense, and ready to communicate in a positive manner.
- **Self-awareness**: Being mindful of your own body language helps you control nervousness and stay present in the conversation.

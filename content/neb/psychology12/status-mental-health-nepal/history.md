# History of Mental Health Services in Nepal: OPD Service, Mental Hospital(s), Psychological Services

Mental health services in Nepal have evolved over time, with significant developments aimed at improving access to care and treatment for individuals with mental health issues. Historically, mental health care in Nepal was not well established, and individuals with mental health problems often faced stigma and limited access to treatment. However, over the years, mental health services have grown, including the establishment of outpatient (OPD) services, mental hospitals, and psychological services.

## OPD Service in Nepal

Outpatient Department (OPD) services in Nepal have been crucial in providing accessible mental health care to the general population. OPD services involve consultations with mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, and counselors, without requiring an overnight stay. These services aim to support individuals dealing with mild to moderate mental health conditions.

Key features of OPD services include:

- **Accessibility**: OPD services are typically available in major hospitals and health centers across the country. This has made mental health care more accessible, especially in urban areas.
  
- **Early Intervention**: OPD services help in the early detection and treatment of mental health conditions. People can receive timely interventions that prevent the worsening of symptoms.
  
- **Mental Health Education**: OPD services also provide education on mental health issues, helping individuals understand their conditions and cope better with daily challenges.

- **Treatment Plans**: These services allow for the development of individualized treatment plans that may include medication, counseling, and therapy.

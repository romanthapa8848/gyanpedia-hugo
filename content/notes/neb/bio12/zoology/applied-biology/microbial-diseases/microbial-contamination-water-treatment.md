# Microbial Contamination of Water, Sewage and Drinking Water Treatment

Water is essential for life, but it is often contaminated by microorganisms that can lead to waterborne diseases and pollution. Microbial contamination occurs when harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa enter the water supply. Sewage, as a major source of contamination, carries pathogens from human waste and other pollutants. Therefore, it is critical to understand how water and sewage are contaminated, and the methods used to treat drinking water to ensure public health.

## Microbial Contamination of Water

Water can be contaminated by various microorganisms that are harmful to human health. These microorganisms can originate from various sources, including sewage, agricultural runoff, and industrial discharge.

### 1. **Sources of Microbial Contamination**

- **Sewage:** Human waste in untreated sewage is a major source of pathogens such as _Escherichia coli_, _Salmonella_, and _Vibrio cholerae_. These microorganisms can contaminate nearby water sources, including rivers, lakes, and groundwater.
- **Agricultural Runoff:** Pesticides, fertilizers, and animal waste used in farming can contain pathogens that leach into water bodies, leading to contamination.
- **Industrial Discharge:** Factories can release untreated waste that contains harmful microorganisms into the water supply.
- **Natural Sources:** In some cases, water may contain natural sources of contamination, such as soil microorganisms or animal waste.

### 2. **Common Waterborne Pathogens**

Some of the most common waterborne pathogens include:

- **Bacteria:** _E. coli_, _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, and _Cholera_ bacteria.
- **Viruses:** Rotavirus, Norovirus, and Hepatitis A.
- **Protozoa:** _Giardia_, _Entamoeba histolytica_, and _Cryptosporidium_.
- **Helminths:** Parasitic worms like _Schistosoma_.

These pathogens can cause diseases such as cholera, typhoid, dysentery, hepatitis, and giardiasis.

### 3. **Health Effects of Contaminated Water**

Consumption of water contaminated by these pathogens can lead to a variety of waterborne diseases that primarily affect the gastrointestinal system. Symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and fever. In severe cases, these diseases can be fatal, especially in young children and immunocompromised individuals.

## Sewage Treatment and Microbial Removal

Sewage treatment involves the removal of contaminants, including harmful microorganisms, from wastewater before it is released back into the environment or reused.

### 1. **Primary Treatment**

Primary treatment involves the physical removal of large solid particles (like debris and sediments) from sewage through screening and sedimentation. However, this method does not effectively remove microorganisms.

### 2. **Secondary Treatment**

Secondary treatment is a biological process that uses microorganisms to break down organic matter in sewage. Aerobic bacteria are introduced to digest organic pollutants. While this step reduces organic contamination, it may not eliminate all pathogens.

### 3. **Tertiary Treatment**

Tertiary treatment is the final stage and may include disinfection methods such as chlorination, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, or ozone treatment. These methods kill remaining microorganisms and improve water quality before the treated sewage is released or reused.

## Drinking Water Treatment

Drinking water must be treated to remove contaminants, including microorganisms, to ensure it is safe for human consumption. The goal of water treatment is to provide clean water free from harmful pathogens and other pollutants.

### 1. **Filtration**

Filtration is used to remove particulate matter, sediments, and larger microorganisms from water. It typically involves passing water through various filter media, such as sand, charcoal, or activated carbon, which trap impurities.

### 2. **Coagulation and Flocculation**

Coagulation involves the addition of chemicals (coagulants) to water, which cause suspended particles to clump together into larger particles called flocs. These flocs are then removed through sedimentation or filtration.

### 3. **Disinfection**

Disinfection is a critical step to ensure that harmful microorganisms are killed before water is distributed. Common methods of disinfection include:

- **Chlorination:** Chlorine or chlorine compounds are used to kill bacteria and other pathogens in water.
- **UV Radiation:** Ultraviolet light is used to inactivate microorganisms, preventing them from reproducing.
- **Ozonation:** Ozone gas is used to kill bacteria and viruses and remove organic contaminants.

### 4. **Reverse Osmosis (RO)**

Reverse osmosis is a membrane filtration process that removes dissolved contaminants, including microorganisms, from water. It is often used for desalination and to purify water in areas with limited access to fresh water.

### 5. **Boiling**

Boiling is a simple yet effective way to kill pathogens in water. By heating water to a rolling boil for at least one minute, harmful microorganisms are destroyed, making the water safe to drink.

## Importance of Safe Drinking Water

Ensuring access to safe drinking water is vital for public health. Microbial contamination of drinking water can lead to outbreaks of waterborne diseases, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Proper treatment and disinfection of water supplies are essential for preventing these health issues.

## Summary

Microbial contamination of water, whether from sewage, agricultural runoff, or industrial discharges, poses a significant threat to human health. Effective treatment of sewage and drinking water through various physical, chemical, and biological processes is essential for removing harmful microorganisms and ensuring water safety. With the right methods, such as filtration, disinfection, and coagulation, it is possible to provide clean, safe drinking water and protect public health from waterborne diseases.

## FAQs

### 1. What are the common waterborne diseases caused by microbial contamination?

Waterborne diseases include cholera, typhoid, dysentery, giardiasis, and hepatitis, which are caused by harmful microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, and protozoa.

### 2. How do microorganisms contaminate water sources?

Microorganisms can contaminate water through sewage, agricultural runoff, industrial discharge, and natural sources such as soil and animal waste.

### 3. What is the role of chlorination in drinking water treatment?

Chlorination is used to disinfect water by killing bacteria, viruses, and other harmful microorganisms, ensuring the water is safe to drink.

### 4. What is the purpose of coagulation and flocculation in water treatment?

Coagulation and flocculation help remove suspended particles and microorganisms from water by causing them to clump together into larger particles (flocs), which can then be removed through filtration or sedimentation.

### 5. How does reverse osmosis work to purify water?

Reverse osmosis uses a semipermeable membrane to remove dissolved contaminants, including microorganisms, from water by forcing it through the membrane under pressure.

### 6. What is the primary method used for treating sewage?

Sewage treatment typically involves primary, secondary, and tertiary stages. The secondary treatment, which uses biological processes like aerobic bacteria to break down organic matter, is the most effective for microbial removal.

### 7. How do UV rays disinfect water?

UV radiation inactivates microorganisms by damaging their DNA, preventing them from reproducing and making the water safe for consumption.

### 8. Why is boiling water effective for killing microorganisms?

Boiling water kills most pathogens by denaturing their proteins and enzymes, preventing them from surviving and reproducing.

### 9. What is the main health risk associated with microbial contamination of water?

The main health risks include gastrointestinal illnesses such as diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, and in severe cases, these diseases can be life-threatening, especially in young children and vulnerable populations.

### 10. What is the most common method for disinfecting drinking water in large-scale treatment plants?

Chlorination is the most common method used in large-scale water treatment plants to disinfect drinking water and kill harmful microorganisms.

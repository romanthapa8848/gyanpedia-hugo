# Physiology of Digestion

The physiology of digestion involves the complex biochemical processes through which food is broken down into simpler molecules that the body can absorb and utilize. This process occurs in multiple stages, beginning in the mouth and ending in the intestines, with various enzymes and digestive juices playing critical roles.

## Phases of Digestion

### a. Ingestion and Mechanical Digestion

- **Ingestion**: The process of taking food into the mouth.
- **Mechanical Digestion**: Chewing and churning break food into smaller particles, facilitating enzyme action. This process occurs in the mouth, stomach, and intestines.

### b. Chemical Digestion

Chemical digestion involves breaking down complex food molecules into simpler substances using enzymes.

1. **Mouth**: Salivary amylase initiates carbohydrate digestion by breaking down starch into maltose.
2. **Stomach**: Gastric juice, containing hydrochloric acid and pepsin, begins protein digestion.
3. **Small Intestine**:
   - **Pancreatic Juice**: Released from the pancreas, it contains amylase, trypsin, and lipase to digest carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
   - **Bile**: Produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, bile emulsifies fats, aiding in their digestion.
   - **Intestinal Juice**: Contains enzymes like maltase, sucrase, and lactase to complete carbohydrate digestion, and peptidases for protein breakdown.

### c. Absorption

Nutrients from digested food are absorbed in the small intestine. Villi and microvilli increase the surface area for absorption, allowing nutrients to enter the bloodstream and lymphatic system.

### d. Elimination

Indigestible substances are moved into the large intestine, where water is reabsorbed, and the remaining waste is formed into feces for excretion.

## Summary

The physiology of digestion is a sequential process where food is mechanically broken down, chemically digested, absorbed, and finally eliminated. Each organ and digestive enzyme plays a specific role in breaking down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, ensuring that the body receives the nutrients it needs.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the role of enzymes in digestion?

Enzymes break down complex food molecules into simpler substances, facilitating absorption in the digestive tract.

### 2. Where does the digestion of carbohydrates begin?

Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth with the enzyme salivary amylase.

### 3. What is the function of bile in digestion?

Bile emulsifies fats, breaking them down into smaller droplets to aid in fat digestion in the small intestine.

### 4. Which enzymes are present in the stomach?

The stomach contains pepsin, an enzyme that initiates protein digestion, and hydrochloric acid, which provides an acidic environment.

### 5. How are nutrients absorbed in the small intestine?

Nutrients are absorbed through villi and microvilli, which increase the surface area of the small intestine, allowing nutrients to enter the bloodstream.

### 6. Where is water reabsorbed in the digestive system?

Water is reabsorbed primarily in the large intestine, solidifying waste before excretion.

### 7. What is the purpose of intestinal juice?

Intestinal juice contains enzymes that complete the digestion of carbohydrates and proteins in the small intestine.

### 8. What happens to undigested food?

Undigested food passes into the large intestine, where water is absorbed, and the remaining waste is prepared for elimination.

### 9. Which organ produces pancreatic juice?

The pancreas produces pancreatic juice, which contains enzymes for digesting carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

### 10. What role does the stomach play in mechanical digestion?

The stomach churns food, mixing it with gastric juices to form a semi-liquid substance called chyme.

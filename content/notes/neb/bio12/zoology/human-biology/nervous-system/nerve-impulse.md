# Origin of Nerve Impulse

A nerve impulse is an electrical signal that travels along the axon of a neuron. It originates when a neuron is stimulated by a chemical or electrical signal, leading to a change in the electrical charge across the neuron's membrane.

## Resting Potential

- **Resting Potential**: Neurons maintain a resting potential of about -70mV, with a higher concentration of sodium (Na+) outside the cell and a higher concentration of potassium (K+) inside the cell. This difference is maintained by the sodium-potassium pump.

## Generation of Action Potential

1. **Stimulus**: A stimulus causes the membrane potential to become less negative, reaching the threshold potential.
2. **Depolarization**: When the threshold is reached, sodium channels open, and sodium ions rush into the neuron, making the inside of the cell more positive.
3. **Repolarization**: After depolarization, potassium channels open, and potassium ions move out, restoring the negative charge inside the cell.
4. **Hyperpolarization**: The membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential before returning to the resting state.

# Conduction of Nerve Impulse

Once the action potential is generated, it travels along the axon of the neuron toward the axon terminals.

## Saltatory Conduction

- In **myelinated neurons**, the action potential jumps from node to node (Nodes of Ranvier), speeding up the conduction of the nerve impulse.
- **Unmyelinated neurons** conduct impulses more slowly as the action potential moves in a continuous manner along the axon.

## Transmission Across Synapse

1. **Neurotransmitters**: When the nerve impulse reaches the axon terminals, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.
2. **Binding to Receptors**: These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, initiating a new action potential in the next neuron.

# Summary

A nerve impulse is an electrical signal generated in response to a stimulus, which triggers a rapid depolarization of the neuron's membrane followed by repolarization. This change in membrane potential propagates along the axon in the form of an action potential, which travels faster in myelinated neurons due to saltatory conduction. Upon reaching the axon terminals, the impulse causes the release of neurotransmitters, which carry the signal across the synapse to the next neuron, continuing the transmission of the nerve impulse throughout the nervous system.

## FAQs

### 1. What is resting potential in a neuron?

Resting potential is the electrical potential across the membrane of a neuron when it is not transmitting a signal, typically around -70mV.

### 2. What happens during depolarization?

During depolarization, sodium channels open, allowing sodium ions to rush into the neuron, making the inside of the cell more positive.

### 3. How does action potential travel along the neuron?

Action potential travels by moving from node to node in myelinated neurons (saltatory conduction) or continuously along unmyelinated neurons.

### 4. What is the role of the sodium-potassium pump in maintaining resting potential?

The sodium-potassium pump maintains the resting potential by pumping sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell, creating a concentration gradient.

### 5. How does an action potential trigger the release of neurotransmitters?

The action potential reaches the axon terminal, causing calcium ions to enter the cell and trigger the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.

### 6. What are neurotransmitters?

Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals across synapses between neurons.

### 7. How does saltatory conduction increase the speed of nerve impulse transmission?

Saltatory conduction allows the action potential to jump between nodes of Ranvier in myelinated neurons, increasing the speed of transmission.

### 8. What is the difference between myelinated and unmyelinated neurons in conduction speed?

Myelinated neurons conduct impulses faster due to saltatory conduction, while unmyelinated neurons conduct impulses more slowly.

### 9. What happens during repolarization?

During repolarization, potassium ions move out of the neuron, restoring the negative charge inside the cell.

### 10. How does the nerve impulse travel across the synapse?

The nerve impulse travels across the synapse by neurotransmitters binding to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, which initiates a new action potential.

# Cardiac Output

Cardiac output (CO) is the volume of blood that the heart pumps per minute. It is a key physiological parameter that reflects the efficiency of the heart in delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues. Cardiac output depends on two main factors: stroke volume (SV) and heart rate (HR).

- **Stroke Volume (SV)**: The volume of blood pumped by the heart with each beat.
- **Heart Rate (HR)**: The number of heartbeats per minute.

The formula for calculating cardiac output is:

$$
CO = SV \times HR
$$

Cardiac output can vary based on activity level, health, and other factors. It is typically around 4.7 to 5.0 liters per minute in a healthy adult at rest.

## Summary

Cardiac output is a crucial factor in maintaining the body’s circulation and is determined by both the stroke volume and heart rate. An increase in either stroke volume or heart rate can increase cardiac output, while a decrease in either will lower it.

## FAQs

### 1. What is cardiac output?

Cardiac output is the amount of blood the heart pumps in one minute. It is determined by the stroke volume and heart rate.

### 2. What factors affect cardiac output?

Cardiac output is affected by stroke volume, heart rate, and conditions such as exercise, stress, and blood volume.

### 3. How is cardiac output measured?

Cardiac output can be measured using different techniques, including the Fick principle, thermodilution, and echocardiography.

### 4. What is the normal range for cardiac output?

The normal cardiac output in a healthy adult at rest is typically between 4.7 and 5.0 liters per minute.

### 5. How does exercise affect cardiac output?

During exercise, cardiac output increases to supply more oxygen and nutrients to muscles.

### 6. Can cardiac output be too low?

Yes, a low cardiac output can lead to poor tissue perfusion and is associated with conditions such as heart failure.

### 7. What is the relationship between stroke volume and cardiac output?

Cardiac output is directly related to stroke volume. If stroke volume increases, cardiac output also increases, assuming heart rate remains constant.

### 8. How does heart rate affect cardiac output?

An increase in heart rate results in an increase in cardiac output, as long as the stroke volume remains constant.

### 9. Can cardiac output be improved with training?

Yes, regular cardiovascular exercise can improve stroke volume and heart rate, which can increase cardiac output and overall cardiovascular health.

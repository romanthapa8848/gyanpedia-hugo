# Concept of Tissues

Tissues are groups of similar cells that work together to perform specific functions in plants. They are essential for growth, support, storage, and transport within the plant. In plants, tissues are mainly divided into two categories: meristematic tissues, which are involved in growth, and permanent tissues, which perform specialized roles after the cells have ceased to divide.

## Summary

Tissues in plants are categorized based on their functions and characteristics. The two main types are meristematic tissues, responsible for growth, and permanent tissues, which include supportive, protective, and conductive tissues. Understanding plant tissues is crucial to grasping how plants grow, transport nutrients, and provide structural support.

## FAQs

### 1. What is a tissue in plants?

A tissue in plants is a group of cells with similar structure and function, working together to perform a specific role.

### 2. What are the main types of tissues in plants?

The main types are meristematic tissues (growth tissues) and permanent tissues (support, protection, and transport).

### 3. What are meristematic tissues?

Meristematic tissues consist of cells that actively divide to facilitate plant growth.

### 4. What are permanent tissues?

Permanent tissues are composed of cells that have ceased to divide and perform specialized functions in plants.

### 5. What is the role of meristematic tissue?

Meristematic tissue is crucial for the growth of plant roots, stems, and leaves by generating new cells.

### 6. How do tissues contribute to plant structure?

Tissues such as supportive and protective tissues provide structural integrity and protection to plants.

### 7. Are all plant tissues the same?

No, plant tissues vary in structure and function to support different plant processes like growth, support, and transport.

### 8. Where is meristematic tissue commonly found?

Meristematic tissue is typically found at the tips of roots and shoots, where plant growth occurs.

### 9. What are simple and complex tissues?

Simple tissues are composed of one type of cell, while complex tissues consist of multiple cell types working together.

### 10. Why are tissues important in plants?

Tissues allow plants to efficiently perform vital functions like growth, support, protection, and nutrient transport.

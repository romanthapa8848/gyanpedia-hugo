# Mechanism of Respiration (Glycolysis, Krebs Cycle, Electron Transport System)

Respiration is the process through which living organisms, including plants, release energy from organic compounds like glucose. This process involves three main stages: Glycolysis, the Krebs Cycle, and the Electron Transport System (ETS). Each stage takes place in different parts of the cell and contributes to the breakdown of glucose to release energy stored in the form of ATP.

## 1. Glycolysis

Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and is the first step in the breakdown of glucose. It involves the conversion of one molecule of glucose (6 carbon atoms) into two molecules of pyruvate (3 carbon atoms each), releasing a small amount of energy in the form of ATP and NADH.

- **Steps involved**:
  - Glucose is phosphorylated to form glucose-6-phosphate.
  - It undergoes a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, resulting in the formation of two pyruvate molecules.
  - A net gain of 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules is achieved.

## 2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)

The Krebs Cycle takes place in the mitochondria and is the second stage of cellular respiration. It further breaks down the products of glycolysis to produce energy-rich molecules like NADH, FADH2, and ATP.

- **Steps involved**:
  - Each pyruvate is converted into Acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs Cycle.
  - Acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetate to form citric acid, which is then broken down in a series of reactions.
  - This cycle generates 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, and 1 ATP per cycle (since each glucose molecule produces two pyruvate molecules, the cycle runs twice per glucose molecule).

## 3. Electron Transport System (ETS)

The Electron Transport System is the final stage of respiration, occurring across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The NADH and FADH2 produced in the earlier stages are used to generate a large amount of ATP.

- **Steps involved**:
  - Electrons from NADH and FADH2 pass through protein complexes embedded in the mitochondrial membrane.
  - As electrons move through the complexes, protons (H+) are pumped into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient.
  - The flow of protons back into the mitochondrial matrix through ATP synthase generates ATP (oxidative phosphorylation).
  - Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor, combining with protons to form water.

## FAQs

### 1. What is Glycolysis?

Glycolysis is the process where glucose is broken down into pyruvate, releasing a small amount of ATP and NADH.

### 2. Where does the Krebs Cycle occur?

The Krebs Cycle occurs in the mitochondria of the cell.

### 3. What is the role of NADH in respiration?

NADH is an electron carrier that transports high-energy electrons to the Electron Transport System, where it helps generate ATP.

### 4. How much ATP is produced in the Krebs Cycle?

The Krebs Cycle produces 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule (since the cycle runs twice per glucose molecule).

### 5. What is oxidative phosphorylation?

Oxidative phosphorylation is the process by which ATP is produced using energy from electrons passed through the Electron Transport System, coupled with oxygen acting as the final electron acceptor.

### 6. Why is oxygen important in cellular respiration?

Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor in the Electron Transport System, forming water and allowing the production of ATP to continue.

### 7. What happens if oxygen is not available?

In the absence of oxygen, the Electron Transport System cannot function, leading to anaerobic respiration, which produces much less ATP.

### 8. Where does the Electron Transport System take place?

The Electron Transport System occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

### 9. How many ATP molecules are produced from one glucose molecule?

A total of about 38 ATP molecules are produced from the complete oxidation of one glucose molecule, including all stages of respiration.

### 10. What is the importance of cellular respiration?

Cellular respiration provides the energy needed for cellular activities and is vital for the survival of cells.

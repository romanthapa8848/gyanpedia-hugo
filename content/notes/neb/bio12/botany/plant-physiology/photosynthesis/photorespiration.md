# Photorespiration

**Photorespiration** is a process that occurs in plants, particularly in **C3 plants**, where oxygen is consumed, and carbon dioxide is released, reducing the efficiency of photosynthesis. It happens when the enzyme **Rubisco**, which normally helps with carbon fixation in the Calvin Cycle, mistakenly attaches oxygen instead of carbon dioxide to a 5-carbon sugar, ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).

## Mechanism of Photorespiration

1. **Initial Reaction**: Rubisco reacts with O₂ instead of CO₂, leading to the formation of a 5-carbon compound and a 2-carbon compound (phosphoglycolate).
2. **Photorespiratory Pathway**: The 2-carbon compound is broken down in the peroxisomes and mitochondria, releasing CO₂ and consuming energy (ATP and NADPH).
3. **Loss of Carbon**: Photorespiration reduces the overall amount of fixed carbon, thus decreasing the efficiency of photosynthesis.

## Factors Affecting Photorespiration

1. **High Oxygen Concentration**: Photorespiration increases when there is more oxygen available for Rubisco to fix.
2. **High Temperature**: Warmer temperatures favor oxygenation by Rubisco over carboxylation, increasing photorespiration.
3. **Light Intensity**: High light intensity can also increase the rate of photorespiration due to the greater production of oxygen in chloroplasts.

## Effects of Photorespiration on Plants

- **Reduction in Photosynthesis Efficiency**: Photorespiration reduces the net production of glucose and other sugars by releasing CO₂ without producing ATP or NADPH.
- **Energy Loss**: The process consumes ATP and NADPH, which are typically used in the Calvin Cycle for producing sugars.
- **Stress on C3 Plants**: In hot and dry conditions, photorespiration can significantly reduce the productivity of C3 plants because Rubisco favors oxygen fixation over carbon fixation.

## Summary

Photorespiration is a process that hampers the efficiency of photosynthesis by consuming oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, particularly in C3 plants. It reduces plant productivity, especially under conditions of high temperature and light intensity.

## FAQs

### 1. What is photorespiration?

Photorespiration is a process in plants where oxygen is consumed, and carbon dioxide is released, reducing the efficiency of photosynthesis.

### 2. Why does photorespiration occur?

Photorespiration occurs because the enzyme Rubisco mistakenly binds with oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, leading to the production of a 2-carbon compound.

### 3. Which plants are most affected by photorespiration?

**C3 plants** are most affected by photorespiration, as Rubisco in these plants tends to fix oxygen instead of carbon dioxide under certain conditions.

### 4. How does temperature affect photorespiration?

Higher temperatures favor the oxygenation reaction by Rubisco, increasing the rate of photorespiration.

### 5. What is the role of Rubisco in photorespiration?

Rubisco is the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction between RuBP and CO₂ in the Calvin Cycle. However, in the presence of high oxygen levels, Rubisco can bind with oxygen, leading to photorespiration.

### 6. Does photorespiration happen in C4 plants?

C4 plants are less affected by photorespiration because they have a mechanism that separates the initial CO₂ fixation from the Calvin Cycle, reducing oxygenation by Rubisco.

### 7. Can photorespiration be eliminated in plants?

Photorespiration cannot be entirely eliminated but can be minimized by the presence of certain pathways like the C4 and CAM pathways, which reduce the oxygenation reaction.

### 8. How does photorespiration affect plant growth?

Photorespiration reduces the overall efficiency of photosynthesis, leading to lower plant growth and productivity.

### 9. What are the consequences of photorespiration in plants under dry conditions?

Under dry conditions, plants may close their stomata to conserve water, leading to higher oxygen concentrations inside the leaf, which increases the rate of photorespiration.

### 10. What is the key difference between photorespiration and photosynthesis?

Photosynthesis involves the fixation of CO₂ to produce glucose, while photorespiration involves the fixation of O₂, releasing CO₂ and consuming energy without producing glucose.

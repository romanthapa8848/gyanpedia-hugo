# Net Asset Value (NAV) of Mutual Funds

**Net Asset Value (NAV)** is the per-unit value of a mutual fund's assets minus its liabilities. It reflects the price at which investors can buy or sell mutual fund units. NAV is a critical metric that represents the fund's performance and is calculated daily based on the market value of the underlying assets.

## Significance of NAV

1. **Determines Fund Value**
   NAV helps investors understand the current value of their investments in the mutual fund.

2. **Pricing Mechanism**
   NAV is used to determine the price at which new units are issued or existing units are redeemed.

3. **Performance Indicator**
   Changes in NAV over time reflect the fund's performance, providing insight into the fund's growth or decline.

4. **Transparency**
   Daily disclosure of NAV ensures transparency, allowing investors to track their investment value.

5. **Investment Decisions**
   NAV assists investors in deciding whether to buy, hold, or redeem mutual fund units.

## Calculation of NAV

The formula for calculating NAV is:

$$
NAV = \frac{\text{(Total Assets of the Fund - Total Liabilities)}}{\text{Number of Outstanding Units}}
$$

### Components:

- **Total Assets:** The market value of all securities and cash held by the fund.
- **Total Liabilities:** Expenses, fees, and other liabilities of the fund.
- **Outstanding Units:** Total units of the mutual fund currently held by investors.

### Example:

If a mutual fund has:

- Total assets = NPR 10,000,000
- Total liabilities = NPR 500,000
- Outstanding units = 100,000

$$
NAV = \frac{10,000,000 - 500,000}{100,000} = NPR 95
$$

This means each unit of the mutual fund is valued at NPR 95.

## Summary

The **Net Asset Value (NAV)** is a vital indicator in mutual funds, showing the per-unit value of the fund's assets after deducting liabilities. It plays a crucial role in pricing, transparency, and decision-making for investors. A higher NAV indicates better fund performance, though it is not the sole determinant of investment potential.

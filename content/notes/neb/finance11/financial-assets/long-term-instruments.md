# Long-term Instruments: Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Bonds/Debentures

Long-term financial instruments are used by companies to raise capital for their operations or expansion. These instruments typically have longer maturities, often extending over several years or decades. The most common long-term financial instruments are **common stock**, **preferred stock**, and **bonds/debentures**. Each of these instruments has unique characteristics that appeal to different types of investors.

## 1. **Common Stock**

Common stock represents ownership in a company. Shareholders of common stock have voting rights at annual meetings and the potential to receive dividends, though these dividends are not guaranteed. Common stockholders are also entitled to a company’s remaining assets in the event of liquidation, after debt holders and preferred stockholders have been paid.

### Characteristics of Common Stock:

- **Ownership**: Common stock represents partial ownership of the company.
- **Voting Rights**: Shareholders can vote on important company matters, such as electing directors or approving mergers.
- **Dividends**: Dividends are paid based on the company’s profitability, but they are not guaranteed.
- **Capital Appreciation**: Investors benefit from the increase in stock price, reflecting the company’s growth and profitability.
- **Risk**: Common stockholders are the last to be paid in case of liquidation, making it a riskier investment compared to debt instruments.

## 2. **Preferred Stock**

Preferred stock is a hybrid financial instrument that combines features of both equity and debt. While preferred stockholders do not typically have voting rights, they have a higher claim on dividends and assets in the event of liquidation than common stockholders. Preferred stockholders are usually paid fixed dividends before any dividends are paid to common stockholders.

### Characteristics of Preferred Stock:

- **Fixed Dividends**: Preferred stockholders receive fixed dividends, which are typically higher than those offered to common stockholders.
- **Priority over Common Stock**: In case of liquidation, preferred stockholders have a higher priority in receiving assets than common stockholders, but after debt holders.
- **No Voting Rights**: Preferred stockholders generally do not have voting rights in the company.
- **Convertible Options**: Some preferred stocks can be converted into common stock at a predetermined ratio, offering potential for capital appreciation.

## 3. **Bonds/Debentures**

Bonds and debentures are debt instruments issued by companies or governments to raise capital. These instruments represent a loan made by the investor to the issuer, which promises to pay interest at regular intervals and return the principal amount at maturity. While bonds are typically backed by specific assets or collateral, debentures are unsecured and rely on the creditworthiness of the issuer.

### Characteristics of Bonds/Debentures:

- **Interest Payments**: Bonds and debentures offer regular interest payments, known as coupon payments, which are generally fixed for the life of the instrument.
- **Maturity**: Bonds and debentures have a specified maturity date, at which point the principal amount is repaid.
- **Security**: Bonds may be secured by collateral (asset-backed), while debentures are unsecured and depend on the issuer’s creditworthiness.
- **Priority in Liquidation**: In the event of liquidation, bondholders and debenture holders are paid before stockholders (both common and preferred).
- **Risk**: Bonds and debentures carry lower risk compared to stocks, but they are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk.

## Summary

Long-term instruments such as common stock, preferred stock, and bonds/debentures play crucial roles in corporate finance, offering different risk and return profiles to investors. **Common stock** offers ownership and voting rights, with variable dividends and potential for high returns through capital appreciation. **Preferred stock** provides fixed dividends and a higher claim on assets than common stock but typically lacks voting rights. **Bonds and debentures**, as debt instruments, provide regular interest payments and priority in liquidation but carry lower risk than stocks.

# Finance Company

A **finance company** is a specialized financial institution that primarily deals with providing medium-term and long-term financing to individuals, small businesses, and corporate clients. Unlike commercial banks, which offer a broad range of banking services, finance companies are focused on lending, investment, and providing credit to meet the specific financial needs of borrowers.

In Nepal, finance companies are regulated by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), which ensures that they maintain proper capital and operational standards to avoid financial instability. These companies play a significant role in filling the gap left by commercial banks by offering more flexible financing options for sectors that may not be eligible for traditional bank loans.

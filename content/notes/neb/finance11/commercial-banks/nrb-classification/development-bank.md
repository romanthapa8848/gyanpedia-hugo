# Development Bank

A **development bank** is a specialized financial institution that provides long-term capital for the development of key sectors in the economy, such as industry, infrastructure, and agriculture. Unlike commercial banks, which primarily focus on short-term financing and retail banking services, development banks focus on financing large-scale projects that promote economic growth and development.

Development banks are typically established with the objective of providing financial support for projects that are crucial for national or regional economic development but may not be viable for commercial banks due to their long-term nature and high risk.

## How Mobile Banking Works

Mobile banking works by allowing customers to use a mobile application (app) provided by their bank. After downloading the app from the respective app store, customers log in using their credentials or biometric authentication. They can then access a range of banking services, including transfers, bill payments, account management, and more.

1. **Account Registration**: The customer registers for mobile banking through the bank’s mobile app or website.
2. **Secure Login**: The customer logs in using a username and password, or biometric authentication such as a fingerprint or face recognition.
3. **Transaction Execution**: Customers can view balances, transfer funds, pay bills, and deposit checks through the app.
4. **Security Protocols**: Banks ensure the use of strong encryption, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and biometric security for safe transactions.

# Computation of Life Insurance Premium

The **premium** is the amount paid by the policyholder to the insurance company in exchange for the coverage provided under a life insurance policy. The **computation of life insurance premiums** is a critical aspect of the life insurance process. It ensures that the insurer can meet its financial obligations in the event of a claim, while also accounting for the risk associated with each policyholder.

The amount of premium depends on various factors, including the age, health, lifestyle, and type of policy selected by the individual. Life insurance premiums are typically calculated based on two primary factors: **the mortality cost** and **the administrative cost**.

## Factors Influencing Life Insurance Premium

The computation of life insurance premiums is influenced by several key factors:

### 1. **Age of the Insured**

The age of the policyholder is one of the most significant factors in determining the premium. Younger individuals typically pay lower premiums because they are perceived to have a lower risk of death. Premiums tend to increase as the policyholder gets older due to the increased risk of mortality.

### 2. **Health of the Insured**

Health plays a crucial role in premium determination. If the policyholder has pre-existing health conditions or a history of serious illnesses, the insurer may charge a higher premium to account for the additional risk. A healthy individual will usually qualify for a lower premium.

### 3. **Gender**

Gender can influence premiums as well, as statistical data shows that women, on average, live longer than men. This often results in lower premiums for female policyholders compared to male policyholders.

### 4. **Occupation**

Certain occupations that are considered **high-risk** (e.g., construction work, mining, etc.) can lead to higher premiums. Insurers assess the risk level associated with a policyholder's job and adjust the premium accordingly.

### 5. **Sum Assured**

The sum assured (the amount that will be paid out to the beneficiary in case of the policyholder’s death) directly influences the premium. A higher sum assured will lead to a higher premium, as the insurer will be liable to pay more in the event of a claim.

### 6. **Type of Policy**

The type of life insurance policy selected (e.g., term life, whole life, endowment policy) affects the premium calculation. For example, **whole life policies** usually have higher premiums compared to **term life policies**, as they provide coverage for the policyholder's entire life.

### 7. **Lifestyle Choices**

Factors such as smoking, drinking, and overall lifestyle can impact the premium. Smokers and individuals with unhealthy lifestyles may face higher premiums due to the increased risk of health issues that can shorten their lifespan.

### 8. **Policy Duration**

The term or duration of the life insurance policy also affects the premium. Generally, **long-term policies** (e.g., 20 years or more) tend to have higher premiums compared to short-term policies because the insurer is at risk for a longer period.

## Methods of Premium Calculation

### 1. **Classical Method (Traditional Method)**

This is the most common method of computing life insurance premiums, where the insurer calculates premiums based on mortality rates (probability of death) and the policyholder’s expected life span. The premium is then adjusted according to the risk and sum assured.

### 2. **Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP) Method**

In this method, a portion of the premium goes toward **investment** (in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds), and the remaining portion covers the **insurance risk**. The premium is based on the policyholder’s choice of investment and insurance coverage.

### 3. **Premium Calculation Formula**

The general formula for calculating life insurance premiums is:

$$
\text{Premium} = \text{Risk Premium} + \text{Administrative Charges}
$$

Where:

- **Risk Premium** is based on factors such as age, health, occupation, and sum assured.
- **Administrative Charges** cover the cost of underwriting, policy administration, and other overheads.

Some insurers may also apply a **loading factor** to account for additional risks or market conditions.

## Example of Premium Calculation

Assume a 30-year-old, non-smoker male is purchasing a **term life policy** with a **sum assured of $100,000** for 20 years. Based on the risk factors and the type of policy, the insurer calculates the **risk premium** as $250 per year and **administrative charges** as $50.

So, the total annual premium would be:

$$
\text{Premium} = 250 + 50 = 300 \text{ per year}
$$

This amount will be paid annually for 20 years, and the policyholder will receive the **sum assured** of $100,000 in case of death during the term of the policy.

## Summary

The **computation of life insurance premiums** involves several factors including the policyholder’s age, health, occupation, type of policy, and lifestyle. Insurers use different methods, such as the **classical method** and **ULIP method**, to calculate premiums. The premium can vary significantly based on individual risk factors and policy features. It is essential for the policyholder to understand these factors when purchasing life insurance.

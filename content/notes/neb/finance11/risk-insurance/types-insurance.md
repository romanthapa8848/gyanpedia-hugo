## Major Types of Insurance

### 1. **Life Insurance**

Life insurance provides financial security to the dependents of the insured in the event of their death. It ensures that the family or beneficiaries are financially supported after the policyholder's passing. There are various forms of life insurance, including:

- **Term Life Insurance**: Provides coverage for a specific term or period. It offers a death benefit only if the insured person dies during the policy term.
- **Whole Life Insurance**: Offers lifelong coverage with an added savings component. It provides a death benefit as well as cash value that grows over time.
- **Endowment Policies**: Provide both life coverage and a lump sum payment after a set period or on the death of the insured, whichever occurs first.

### 2. **Health Insurance**

Health insurance covers the costs of medical expenses, including doctor visits, hospital stays, surgeries, and medications. It helps individuals manage the financial burden of medical treatments. Health insurance plans may vary depending on the coverage provided, such as:

- **General Liability Insurance**: Covers a wide range of risks, including injuries to others or damage to their property caused by the insured’s actions.

## Concept of Risk

Risk is the uncertainty associated with the future, where the outcome of an event is unknown.

### Key Aspects of Risk:

1. **Uncertainty:** Risk is associated with the uncertainty of future events. The outcome could either be positive or negative.
2. **Probability:** The likelihood of a risk occurring is an important factor in understanding and managing it.
3. **Impact:** The consequences or severity of the risk, if it occurs, play a significant role in risk assessment.

## Meaning of Annuity

An **annuity** involves a sequence of periodic payments made or received for a set period. It could be a set of deposits made at regular intervals (like monthly, quarterly, or annually) into a savings account, or a series of payments received, like in the case of pensions.

Key features of an annuity include:

- **Regular Payments**: Payments or receipts are made at consistent intervals.
- **Fixed Amount**: The amount of each payment is constant over the life of the annuity.
- **Time Period**: Annuities are based on a fixed period, after which the payments cease.

Annuities are used in various financial products such as pensions, insurance policies, and investment funds.

## Types of Annuities

Annuities can be classified based on when payments begin, how long payments continue, and how they are structured. The following are the main types of annuities:

### 1. **Annuity Due**

An **annuity due** is an annuity where payments are made at the beginning of each period. For example, if the payment period is annual, the payment is made at the start of the year.

#### Characteristics:

- Payments are made at the beginning of each period.
- Examples include rent payments, insurance premiums, and some pension plans.

### 2. **Ordinary Annuity (or Annuity in Arrears)**

In an **ordinary annuity**, payments are made at the end of each period. For example, if the payment period is annual, the payment is made at the end of the year.

#### Characteristics:

- Payments are made at the end of each period.
- Common in most loan repayments, such as mortgages or bonds.

### 3. **Fixed Annuity**

A **fixed annuity** provides guaranteed payments of a fixed amount over a specified period of time or for the lifetime of the annuitant. The amount of each payment is predetermined and does not change, providing a predictable income stream.

#### Characteristics:

- Fixed periodic payments.
- Commonly used in retirement planning, such as pension plans.

### 4. **Variable Annuity**

A **variable annuity** involves payments that can vary based on the performance of investments chosen by the annuitant. The annuitant has the option to invest in a range of options such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, and the amount of payment depends on the returns of those investments.

#### Characteristics:

- Payments are not fixed and can vary.
- Typically offers the potential for higher returns, but with more risk involved.
- Often used in retirement accounts or investment products.

### 5. **Immediate Annuity**

An **immediate annuity** starts making payments immediately after the initial investment is made. There is no waiting period for the payments to begin.

#### Characteristics:

- Payments begin immediately after the lump sum is invested.
- Common in situations like retirement, where the annuitant wants to start receiving income right away.

### 6. **Deferred Annuity**

A **deferred annuity** is an annuity where the payments begin after a certain period, usually several years after the initial investment. It can be used as a tool for retirement planning, where the individual makes periodic or lump sum payments now and starts receiving payments at a later time.

#### Characteristics:

- Payments are delayed until a specified future date.
- Typically used for retirement savings or long-term investment planning.

# Future Value and Present Value of Single Cash Flow

In financial analysis, the **Future Value (FV)** and **Present Value (PV)** of a single cash flow are critical concepts used to evaluate the value of money over time. They are based on the idea that money today is worth more than the same amount in the future, which is a fundamental principle of **Time Value of Money (TVM)**.

## Future Value (FV) of a Single Cash Flow

**Future Value (FV)** refers to the value of a cash flow at a specified point in the future, considering a given interest rate or rate of return. It answers the question: "How much will a present amount of money be worth in the future?"

### Formula for Future Value (FV):

The formula for calculating the Future Value of a single cash flow is:

$$
FV = PV \times (1 + r)^t
$$

Where:

- $ FV $ = Future Value
- $ PV $ = Present Value (the current value of the cash flow)
- $ r $ = Interest rate or rate of return per period
- $ t $ = Number of time periods (years, months, etc.)

### Example of Future Value:

Suppose you invest $1,000 today at an annual interest rate of 5% for 3 years. The future value would be:

$$
FV = 1,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^3
$$

$$
FV = 1,000 \times 1.157625 = 1,157.63
$$

So, the future value of \$1,000 after 3 years at 5% interest is **\$1,157.63**.

## Present Value (PV) of a Single Cash Flow

**Present Value (PV)** refers to the current value of a cash flow that will be received or paid at a future date. It answers the question: "How much is a future amount of money worth in today's terms?"

### Formula for Present Value (PV):

The formula for calculating the Present Value of a single future cash flow is:

$$
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

Where:

- $ PV $ = Present Value
- $ FV $ = Future Value (the value of the cash flow at the future time)
- $ r $ = Interest rate or rate of return per period
- $ t $ = Number of time periods (years, months, etc.)

### Example of Present Value:

Suppose you are promised $1,500 in 4 years, and the annual interest rate is 6%. To calculate the present value of this amount, the formula will be:

$$
PV = \frac{1,500}{(1 + 0.06)^4}
$$

$$
PV = \frac{1,500}{1.262476} = 1,188.71
$$

So, the present value of \$1,500 to be received in 4 years at 6% interest is **\$1,188.71**.

## Importance of FV and PV

1. **Investment Decisions**:  
   Understanding the future and present values helps investors assess the profitability of investments, especially when comparing cash flows received at different times.

2. **Financial Planning**:  
   Calculating future and present values allows businesses and individuals to plan for future expenses and determine how much to invest today to meet future financial goals.

3. **Loan Repayments**:  
   These calculations are important for understanding the impact of interest rates on loans. Present Value helps determine the current cost of future debt, while Future Value helps in estimating how much a loan will cost by its maturity.

---

## Summary

- **Future Value (FV)** is the value of a current cash flow at a future date, considering a given rate of return or interest rate.
- **Present Value (PV)** is the current value of a future cash flow, discounted at the rate of return or interest rate over a given period.
- Both FV and PV are foundational in the field of **Time Value of Money (TVM)** and are crucial for making informed financial decisions.

## FAQs

### 1. How do you solve for interest rate in the Time Value of Money formula?

To solve for interest rate, rearrange the **Future Value** formula:  
$$ r = \left( \frac{FV}{PV} \right)^{\frac{1}{t}} - 1 $$

### 2. Can we solve for time period if the Future Value and Present Value are known?

Yes, using the formula:  
$$ t = \frac{\log\left( \frac{FV}{PV} \right)}{\log(1 + r)} $$

### 3. What is the role of logarithms in solving for time period or interest rate?

Logarithms help solve equations where the variable is in the exponent, allowing us to solve for $t$ or $r$ effectively.

### 4. How is the interest rate related to the growth of an investment?

A higher interest rate will lead to faster growth of an investment, as interest is compounded at a higher rate.

### 5. How can these formulas be used in practical finance?

These formulas are used to evaluate investments, loans, and savings, helping individuals and businesses make informed financial decisions.

### 6. Is it possible to solve for interest rate if the investment period is unknown?

Yes, as long as you know the Future Value, Present Value, and the interest rate, the period can be derived.

### 7. How does the time period impact the future value of an investment?

A longer time period allows for more compounding, thus increasing the future value of an investment at the same interest rate.

### 8. Why is understanding the Time Value of Money important for financial planning?

It allows investors to make informed decisions about savings, investments, loans, and retirement planning by factoring in how money grows over time.

### 9. Can you use these formulas for any type of investment?

Yes, they are applicable to most types of investments where the future value can be determined based on present value and interest rates.

### 10. How do these calculations help businesses?

These calculations help businesses evaluate the profitability of investments, assess risks, and determine the time required to achieve financial goals.

## Structure of a Cooperative

The structure of a cooperative is designed to promote participation, transparency, and accountability. The main components of cooperative structure include the following:

### 1. **General Assembly (Members' Meeting)**

- **Role:** The General Assembly is the highest decision-making body in a cooperative. It consists of all the members of the cooperative, who are entitled to attend and participate in meetings. The General Assembly makes crucial decisions regarding the policies, direction, and major activities of the cooperative.

- **Functions:**

  - Approving the annual report and financial statements.
  - Electing the Board of Directors.
  - Deciding on the distribution of profits or dividends.
  - Approving major business decisions, such as mergers or expansion.

- **Democratic Principle:** Every member has one vote regardless of their stake or share in the cooperative. This ensures equal representation and the democratic nature of cooperatives.

### 2. **Board of Directors**

- **Role:** The Board of Directors is elected by the members from among themselves. They are responsible for the overall governance and strategic direction of the cooperative. The Board ensures that the cooperative operates in the best interest of its members and adheres to the cooperative's principles and values.

- **Functions:**
  - Setting long-term strategies and objectives.
  - Overseeing the operations and management of the cooperative.
  - Ensuring compliance with legal, regulatory, and financial requirements.
  - Making decisions on behalf of the General Assembly between meetings.

### 3. **Management/Executive Committee**

- **Role:** The Management or Executive Committee is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the cooperative. It implements the policies set by the Board and manages the cooperative's activities. This team is usually led by a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or General Manager.

- **Functions:**
  - Implementing the Board's strategic decisions.
  - Managing the cooperative’s resources, such as finances, human resources, and assets.
  - Ensuring that the cooperative meets its objectives and adheres to operational plans.
  - Reporting regularly to the Board and members on the cooperative's performance.

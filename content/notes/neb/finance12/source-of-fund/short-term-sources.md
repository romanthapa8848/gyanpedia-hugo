# Short Term Sources: Types, Advantages, and Disadvantages

Short-term financing refers to funds that are borrowed or raised for a period typically less than a year. These funds are used to meet immediate or short-term needs, such as managing working capital, paying current liabilities, or funding seasonal operations. Short-term sources of finance are vital for maintaining liquidity and supporting the day-to-day operations of a business.

## **Types of Short-Term Sources of Finance**

### 1. **Bank Overdraft**

A bank overdraft is a credit facility provided by banks that allows businesses to withdraw more money than what is available in their current account, up to a specified limit.

#### Key Features:

- Provides immediate liquidity.
- Can be accessed as needed up to the limit.
- Interest is charged on the amount overdrawn.

### 2. **Trade Credit**

Trade credit is the credit extended by suppliers to businesses for the purchase of goods and services. It allows businesses to delay payments for a certain period (usually 30 to 90 days).

#### Key Features:

- No immediate cash outflow.
- Interest-free, as long as payments are made on time.
- The amount of credit depends on the supplier's terms.

### 3. **Bill of Exchange**

A bill of exchange is a written order used in international trade that requires the buyer to pay a specified amount on a certain date. It can be used as a short-term source of finance by discounting the bill with a bank.

#### Key Features:

- Provides funds quickly.
- Can be discounted with a bank for immediate cash.
- Used mostly in international trade.

### 4. **Commercial Paper**

Commercial paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by companies to raise funds. It typically has a maturity period of up to 270 days and is usually issued by large companies with strong credit ratings.

#### Key Features:

- Issued at a discount to face value.
- Short maturity, usually up to 270 days.
- Low-interest rates compared to bank loans.

### 5. **Short-Term Loans**

Short-term loans are loans taken from financial institutions or banks with a repayment period of one year or less. These loans are used to meet immediate financial needs.

#### Key Features:

- Fixed repayment period.
- Interest is charged on the loan amount.
- Collateral may be required, depending on the lender's terms.

### 6. **Factoring**

Factoring involves selling a company’s accounts receivable (invoices) to a third party (called a factor) at a discount in exchange for immediate cash. This helps businesses meet short-term liquidity needs.

#### Key Features:

- Provides immediate cash for receivables.
- The factor assumes the risk of non-payment.
- Typically involves a fee or discount on the receivables.

## **Advantages of Short-Term Sources of Finance**

1. **Quick Availability**: Short-term financing options are usually quicker to arrange than long-term financing, providing immediate liquidity to businesses.
2. **Flexibility**: Many short-term sources, like bank overdrafts and trade credit, offer flexibility in terms of usage and repayment, making them suitable for fluctuating cash flow needs.

3. **Lower Interest Rates**: Short-term sources of finance generally come with lower interest rates compared to long-term loans, making them cost-effective for temporary funding.

4. **No Collateral Required**: Many short-term financing options, such as trade credit, do not require collateral, reducing the risk for the business owner.

5. **Short Repayment Period**: Since short-term financing is typically repaid within a year, businesses are not burdened with long-term debt obligations.

## **Disadvantages of Short-Term Sources of Finance**

1. **Higher Interest Rates (for some sources)**: While many short-term financing options have lower rates, sources like short-term loans and commercial paper can sometimes carry relatively high-interest rates, depending on the business’s credit rating.

2. **Risk of Over-Reliance**: Relying too heavily on short-term sources of finance can lead to liquidity problems and may cause a business to face a cash flow crunch if repayments are not managed properly.

3. **Limited Availability**: Some short-term financing options, such as commercial paper, may only be available to large businesses with strong credit histories, making them inaccessible to smaller firms.

4. **Potential Impact on Relationships with Suppliers**: Excessive use of trade credit or delayed payments can strain relationships with suppliers, potentially leading to reduced credit limits or a loss of credit terms.

5. **Repayment Pressure**: The short repayment terms for these sources can create pressure on businesses to generate cash quickly, which could impact overall financial stability.

## Summary

Short-term sources of finance are essential for businesses to meet immediate operational and liquidity needs. Common types include **bank overdrafts**, **trade credit**, **commercial paper**, and **factoring**. While these sources provide quick access to capital with fewer requirements, they also come with risks such as higher interest rates and potential cash flow challenges. It is crucial for businesses to manage these sources carefully to avoid over-reliance and maintain financial stability.

# On the Basis of Time: Short Term vs. Long Term

Businesses require capital to operate and grow, and the source of this capital is often categorized based on the time frame for repayment or utilization. The primary categories are **short-term** and **long-term** financing. Each type serves different business needs and comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

## **Short-Term Sources of Capital**

Short-term capital refers to funds that a company borrows or raises for a period typically less than a year. These funds are used to meet immediate operational expenses and manage cash flow challenges. They are generally used for working capital requirements, such as inventory purchases, paying salaries, or managing receivables.

### Common Short-Term Sources:

- **Trade Credit**: The most common form of short-term financing, where businesses receive goods or services on credit with the promise of paying later (typically within 30 to 90 days).
- **Bank Overdraft**: A facility that allows businesses to withdraw more money from their bank account than they currently have.
- **Short-Term Loans**: Loans with a maturity period of one year or less, typically used for immediate business expenses.
- **Commercial Paper**: Unsecured promissory notes issued by companies to raise short-term funds, usually repaid within 270 days.
- **Factoring**: Selling accounts receivable to a third party at a discount in exchange for immediate cash.

### Advantages of Short-Term Financing:

- Quick and easy access to funds.
- Flexible repayment terms.
- Low interest rates, especially for trade credit.

### Disadvantages of Short-Term Financing:

- Higher risk of liquidity issues if not managed properly.
- Frequent need for refinancing.
- May not be suitable for long-term investment.

## **Long-Term Sources of Capital**

Long-term capital refers to funds raised for a period longer than a year. These sources are generally used for major investments, such as buying equipment, acquiring new businesses, or funding long-term projects. Long-term capital typically provides more stability and allows businesses to undertake significant growth opportunities.

### Common Long-Term Sources:

- **Equity Financing**: Raising funds by issuing shares to investors. This provides long-term capital and shares ownership in the company.
- **Long-Term Loans**: Loans that are paid back over a period greater than one year, typically used for capital expenditures like purchasing fixed assets.
- **Bonds**: Debt securities issued by companies that pay regular interest and return the principal amount on maturity.
- **Leases**: Financing options that allow businesses to acquire assets without purchasing them outright, with the agreement to lease over a long period.
- **Venture Capital**: Funds raised from investors for high-growth potential businesses in exchange for equity or ownership interest.

### Advantages of Long-Term Financing:

- Provides stability and security for major investments.
- Typically lower interest rates over a longer period.
- Does not require frequent refinancing.

### Disadvantages of Long-Term Financing:

- Interest payments or dividend obligations.
- Dilution of ownership (in case of equity financing).
- Longer commitment to debt repayments.

# The Dividend Discount Model: Zero Growth Model and Constant Growth Model

The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is a method used to value a company's stock by determining the present value of its future dividends. There are two main variations of the Dividend Discount Model: the **Zero Growth Model** and the **Constant Growth Model**. These models are based on the assumption that dividends will continue to be paid by the company at a fixed rate.

## **Zero Growth Model**

The Zero Growth Model is a simple version of the DDM, which assumes that a company will pay a constant dividend that does not change over time. The stock's value is calculated by dividing the expected dividend by the required rate of return.

### **Formula for Zero Growth Model**

The formula to calculate the value of a stock using the Zero Growth Model is:

$$
P_0 = \frac{D}{r}
$$

Where:

- $P_0$ = Price of the stock today (current stock price)
- $D$ = Dividend payment (constant)
- $r$ = Required rate of return (discount rate)

In the Zero Growth Model, since the dividend does not change over time, the stock price is simply the present value of an infinite stream of constant dividends.

## **Constant Growth Model (Gordon Growth Model)**

The Constant Growth Model, also known as the **Gordon Growth Model**, is an extension of the Zero Growth Model. It assumes that the dividends will grow at a constant rate, $g$, indefinitely. This model is more realistic for companies with a stable growth rate for dividends.

### **Formula for Constant Growth Model**

The formula for the Constant Growth Model is:

$$
P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r - g}
$$

Where:

- $P_0$ = Price of the stock today (current stock price)
- $D_1$ = Dividend in the next period (usually one year)
- $r$ = Required rate of return (discount rate)
- $g$ = Constant growth rate of dividends

In this model, the stock price is calculated as the present value of all future dividends, which are expected to grow at a constant rate $g$. This formula assumes that the growth rate $g$ is less than the required rate of return $r$.

## **Key Differences Between Zero Growth Model and Constant Growth Model**

1. **Dividend Growth**:

   - **Zero Growth Model**: Assumes that the dividend remains constant over time.
   - **Constant Growth Model**: Assumes that the dividend will grow at a constant rate.

2. **Application**:

   - **Zero Growth Model**: Suitable for companies with stable dividends that are not expected to grow.
   - **Constant Growth Model**: More applicable to companies with a predictable growth rate for dividends.

3. **Stock Valuation**:
   - **Zero Growth Model**: The value of the stock is simply the present value of constant dividends.
   - **Constant Growth Model**: The value of the stock is based on the present value of growing dividends.

| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dividend Growth**            | Assumes no growth in dividends (constant dividends)               | Assumes dividends grow at a constant rate $g$                             |
| **Formula**                    | $$ P_0 = \frac{D}{r} $$                                           | $$ P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r - g} $$                                             |
| **Application**                | Suitable for companies with stable, unchanging dividends          | Suitable for companies with predictable and stable dividend growth        |
| **Stock Valuation**            | Stock price is the present value of constant dividends            | Stock price is the present value of growing dividends                     |
| **Complexity**                 | Simpler and more straightforward                                  | More complex due to the growth factor in the formula                      |
| **Usefulness**                 | Useful for valuing companies with no expected growth in dividends | Useful for valuing companies with consistent dividend growth              |
| **Rate of Return ($r$)**       | Discount rate is used to divide the constant dividend             | Discount rate ($r$) is compared with growth rate ($g$) to value the stock |
| **Required Growth Rate ($g$)** | Not applicable (no growth assumed)                                | Essential and must be less than the required rate of return for stability |

## Summary

The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is a widely used tool in stock valuation. The **Zero Growth Model** values a stock based on constant dividends, while the **Constant Growth Model** takes into account a fixed growth rate in dividends. Both models help investors estimate the intrinsic value of a stock based on future cash flows (dividends) and the required rate of return.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the Dividend Discount Model (DDM)?

The Dividend Discount Model is a method used to value a stock by determining the present value of its future dividends.

### 2. What is the Zero Growth Model in DDM?

The Zero Growth Model assumes that the dividends of a company remain constant indefinitely, and the stock is valued as the present value of these constant dividends.

### 3. How does the Constant Growth Model differ from the Zero Growth Model?

The Constant Growth Model assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate, while the Zero Growth Model assumes constant dividends without growth.

### 4. When should the Zero Growth Model be used?

The Zero Growth Model is useful for valuing stocks of companies that pay consistent dividends without any expected growth.

### 5. When is the Constant Growth Model applicable?

The Constant Growth Model is applicable to companies with predictable and stable growth in dividends over time.

### 6. What does the formula for the Constant Growth Model look like?

The formula is $$ P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r - g} $$ where $D_1$ is the next period's dividend, $r$ is the required rate of return, and $g$ is the constant growth rate of dividends.

### 7. What happens if the required rate of return $r$ is equal to the growth rate $g$ in the Constant Growth Model?

If $r = g$, the formula for the Constant Growth Model becomes undefined. The stock price would tend to infinity, which is not a practical scenario.

### 8. Can the Zero Growth Model be used for companies that have a growth rate?

No, the Zero Growth Model should only be used for companies with no expected growth in dividends. If the company has a stable growth rate, the Constant Growth Model would be more appropriate.

### 9. How do changes in the discount rate ($r$) affect the stock price in both models?

- In the Zero Growth Model, as $r$ increases, the stock price decreases, since the value of the stock is the present value of constant dividends.
- In the Constant Growth Model, an increase in $r$ also decreases the stock price, but if $r$ approaches $g$, the stock price will decrease sharply, and if $r$ becomes less than $g$, the formula becomes invalid.

### 10. Which model is better for valuing high-growth companies?

The Constant Growth Model is more suitable for valuing high-growth companies as it takes into account the growth rate of dividends. The Zero Growth Model, being simpler, is ideal for companies with no growth in dividends.

# Meaning and Key Features of Common Stock

Common stock represents ownership in a corporation and constitutes a claim on part of the company’s assets and earnings. As an equity security, common stockholders are essentially partial owners of the company. Unlike debt holders, common shareholders are not guaranteed a return on their investment but stand to gain from the company's growth and profitability.

## **Meaning of Common Stock**

Common stock is the most prevalent type of equity security issued by companies. Holders of common stock have voting rights in corporate decisions and are eligible to receive dividends. They benefit from the company’s success, but they are also the last to be paid in the event of liquidation, after all debt holders and preferred stockholders.

## **Key Features of Common Stock**

### **1. Ownership and Voting Rights**

- Common stockholders are partial owners of the company. They have the right to vote on corporate matters, including the election of the board of directors, mergers, and other significant decisions.
- Each share of common stock typically entitles the holder to one vote, although the company may issue different classes of stock with varying voting rights.

### **2. Dividends**

- Common stockholders may receive dividends, which are periodic payments made from the company’s profits. However, dividend payments are not guaranteed and depend on the company's performance and the decision of the board of directors.
- The dividend amount can fluctuate, and common shareholders are paid after preferred stockholders in the event of liquidation.

### **3. Capital Appreciation**

- Common stockholders benefit from capital appreciation, meaning the value of their shares can increase as the company grows and becomes more profitable.
- The potential for capital appreciation is a major reason investors buy common stock.

### **4. Residual Claim**

- In the event of liquidation, common stockholders have a residual claim on the company’s assets. This means they are the last to receive any remaining funds after all liabilities (debts and preferred stock) are paid.
- The residual claim is a risk, as there may be little or nothing left for common stockholders if the company is liquidated.

### **5. Limited Liability**

- Common stockholders have limited liability, meaning they are not personally liable for the company’s debts. Their financial loss is limited to the amount they invested in the stock.

### **6. Transferability**

- Common stock is generally transferable, meaning investors can buy and sell their shares in the open market (if the stock is publicly traded).
- This liquidity makes common stock an attractive investment for those seeking to trade their shares easily.

## Summary

Common stock represents ownership in a company and entitles shareholders to voting rights, dividends, and the potential for capital appreciation. However, common stockholders are the last to be paid in case of liquidation and face more risk compared to preferred stockholders. Despite these risks, common stock offers the potential for significant rewards and plays a vital role in the financial markets.

# Dividend Payment Schemes: Stable, Constant Payout, and Low Regular Plus Extra

Companies follow different dividend payment schemes to distribute profits to their shareholders. These schemes are designed based on the company’s earnings, business goals, and market conditions. The three main dividend payment schemes are the **Stable Dividend**, **Constant Payout**, and **Low Regular Plus Extra**. Let’s explore each of these in detail.

## Stable Dividend Scheme

### **Concept of Stable Dividend**

A stable dividend scheme refers to a situation where a company pays a fixed dividend per share, which remains unchanged over time. This approach is common among mature companies with steady and predictable earnings. The company aims to provide shareholders with a reliable income stream, regardless of minor fluctuations in profits.

### **Features of Stable Dividend Scheme**

- **Predictable Payments**: Shareholders receive a fixed amount of dividend regularly.
- **Consistency**: The dividend remains constant even if the company's earnings fluctuate.
- **Preferred by Risk-Averse Investors**: This scheme is preferred by investors looking for predictable returns.

### **Advantages**

- **Stability**: Provides shareholders with consistent dividends.
- **Trust**: Builds trust and confidence among investors, especially those relying on dividends for income.
- **Reputation**: Enhances the company's reputation for reliability.

## Constant Payout Dividend Scheme

### **Concept of Constant Payout Dividend**

The constant payout scheme involves distributing a fixed percentage of the company’s earnings as dividends. For example, if the company has a policy of paying 40% of its net income as dividends, this percentage remains the same every year, regardless of changes in profits.

### **Features of Constant Payout Scheme**

- **Percentage-based Payments**: The dividend is a fixed percentage of the company’s earnings.
- **Variable Amounts**: The actual dividend amount may vary depending on the company’s profitability.
- **Flexible**: Adjusts to changes in the company’s earnings, ensuring that dividends are paid in proportion to the company’s performance.

### **Advantages**

- **Flexible**: Allows the company to adjust its dividend payout according to its profitability.
- **Avoids Overburdening**: Helps prevent the company from paying out more than it can afford.
- **Reflects Profitability**: Aligns dividends with the company’s financial health, so shareholders are paid according to the company’s earnings.

## Low Regular Plus Extra Dividend Scheme

### **Concept of Low Regular Plus Extra Dividend**

Under this scheme, the company pays a low but regular dividend and supplements it with additional "extra" dividends when the company has surplus profits. This scheme allows flexibility in dividend payments, accommodating both stable payouts and periodic additional distributions based on the company’s performance.

### **Features of Low Regular Plus Extra Scheme**

- **Fixed Regular Dividend**: Shareholders receive a stable, low dividend as a base payment.
- **Extra Dividends**: When the company has excess profits, it pays an additional dividend.
- **Variable Total Dividends**: The total dividend paid can vary, depending on the company’s profits and financial position.

### **Advantages**

- **Flexibility**: Offers flexibility to pay higher dividends in good years without committing to higher regular payouts.
- **Attractive to Shareholders**: Shareholders receive a base income, with the potential for additional income in strong performance years.
- **Encourages Long-Term Investment**: Shareholders may hold on to shares longer, knowing that they may receive higher payouts in profitable years.

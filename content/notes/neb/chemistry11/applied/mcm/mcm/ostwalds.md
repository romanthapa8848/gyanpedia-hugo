# Manufacture of Nitric Acid by Ostwald’s Process

The manufacture of nitric acid (HNO₃) is a crucial process in industrial chemistry, particularly for the production of fertilizers, explosives, and other chemicals. The **Ostwald Process** is the most widely used method for the large-scale production of nitric acid.

## 1. Chemical Reactions

The Ostwald Process involves the oxidation of ammonia to produce nitric oxide (NO), which is then further oxidized to nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and finally absorbed in water to form nitric acid.

The key reactions involved are as follows:

1. **Oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide (NO):**
$$
4NH₃ (g) + 3O₂ (g) \xrightarrow{Pt, 900°C} 2N₂ (g) + 6H₂O (g)
$$

2. **Oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide (NO₂):**
$$
2NO (g) + O₂ (g) \xrightarrow{450°C} 2NO₂ (g)
$$

3. **Absorption of nitrogen dioxide in water to form nitric acid:**
$$
2NO₂ (g) + H₂O (l) \xrightarrow{} HNO₃ (aq) + HNO₂ (aq)
$$

In the final step, the nitric acid is concentrated and purified to produce the desired product.

## 2. Conditions for the Ostwald Process

To achieve the required reactions efficiently, specific conditions are used:
- **Temperature**: The reaction occurs at high temperatures (around 900°C) in the presence of a platinum (Pt) catalyst.
- **Catalyst**: Platinum or rhodium is commonly used as a catalyst for the oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide. These metals are effective due to their high reactivity and ability to withstand the harsh conditions.
- **Pressure**: Moderate pressures are used during the oxidation stages, but the final absorption step occurs at atmospheric pressure.

## 3. Steps Involved in the Ostwald Process

### a) **Preparation of Ammonia**
- Ammonia gas is prepared either from the Haber Process or directly from natural gas. It is purified before being fed into the reactor.

### b) **Oxidation of Ammonia**
- The purified ammonia is mixed with air and passed over a heated platinum catalyst at around 900°C. The reaction oxidizes ammonia to nitric oxide (NO) and water vapor.

### c) **Oxidation of Nitric Oxide to Nitrogen Dioxide**
- The nitric oxide is further oxidized by oxygen at 450°C to form nitrogen dioxide (NO₂).

### d) **Absorption of Nitrogen Dioxide**
- The nitrogen dioxide is absorbed in water to form nitric acid. This step may produce a mixture of nitric acid and nitrous acid (HNO₂), which can be further treated to produce pure nitric acid.

### e) **Concentration of Nitric Acid**
- The dilute nitric acid formed in the absorption step is concentrated by distillation or other processes to obtain concentrated nitric acid, which is commercially used.

## 4. Importance of Nitric Acid

Nitric acid is an essential industrial chemical. Its primary uses include:
- The production of **ammonium nitrate** for fertilizers and explosives.
- The manufacture of **nitrocompounds**, including TNT (trinitrotoluene), which is used in the defense industry.
- **Pickling of metals**, particularly in the automotive and steel industries.
- As a **reagent** in laboratories and chemical syntheses.

## 5. Efficiency and Yield

The Ostwald Process is highly efficient, but it still operates at a moderate yield due to the need for high temperatures and the expensive platinum catalyst. The process is continuously optimized to improve yield and reduce energy consumption.

## Summary

The Ostwald Process is a vital industrial method for producing nitric acid, which plays a significant role in fertilizer production, explosives manufacturing, and other chemical industries. By using high temperatures, a platinum catalyst, and moderate pressures, the process efficiently converts ammonia into nitric acid through a series of oxidation and absorption reactions.

# Oxidation Number and Rules for Assigning Oxidation Number

---

## Oxidation Number

The **oxidation number** (also called oxidation state) of an element in a compound is a measure of the number of electrons that an atom in the compound has gained, lost, or shared when forming a chemical bond. It is a theoretical concept used to track electron transfer in redox reactions.

## General Rules for Assigning Oxidation Numbers

The oxidation number of an element can be determined by following a set of rules. These rules are:

1. **Oxidation number of an element in its free state is 0**:

   - For example, in $O_2$, $N_2$, or $H_2$, the oxidation number of each atom is 0.

2. **Oxidation number of a monoatomic ion is equal to the charge of the ion**:

   - For example, the oxidation number of $Na^+$ is +1, and the oxidation number of $Cl^-$ is -1.

3. **Oxidation number of hydrogen is +1** when bonded to nonmetals:

   - For example, in $H_2O$, the oxidation number of hydrogen is +1.
   - In metal hydrides like $NaH$, the oxidation number of hydrogen is -1.

4. **Oxidation number of oxygen is -2** in most compounds:

   - For example, in $H_2O$, $CO_2$, and $Na_2O$, the oxidation number of oxygen is -2.
   - Exceptions: In peroxides (e.g., $H_2O_2$), oxygen has an oxidation number of -1. In $OF_2$, oxygen has an oxidation number of +2.

5. **Oxidation number of fluorine is always -1** in compounds.

   - For example, in $HF$, the oxidation number of fluorine is -1.

6. **Oxidation number of other halogens (Cl, Br, I) is usually -1**, unless they are combined with oxygen or other halogens where the oxidation number can be positive.

7. **The sum of the oxidation numbers of all atoms in a neutral compound is 0**:

   - For example, in $H_2O$, the sum of the oxidation numbers of hydrogen (+1 for each hydrogen) and oxygen (-2) is 0.

8. **The sum of the oxidation numbers of all atoms in a polyatomic ion is equal to the charge of the ion**:
   - For example, in $SO_4^{2-}$, the sum of the oxidation numbers of sulfur and oxygen must equal -2.

## Examples of Assigning Oxidation Numbers

1. **In $H_2O$**:

   - Oxidation number of H = +1 (each hydrogen atom).
   - Oxidation number of O = -2.
   - Sum = $2(+1) + (-2) = 0$.

2. **In $NaCl$**:

   - Oxidation number of Na = +1.
   - Oxidation number of Cl = -1.
   - Sum = $(+1) + (-1) = 0$.

3. **In $CO_2$**:

   - Oxidation number of C = +4.
   - Oxidation number of O = -2.
   - Sum = $(+4) + 2(-2) = 0$.

4. **In $SO_4^{2-}$**:
   - Oxidation number of S = +6.
   - Oxidation number of O = -2.
   - Sum = $(+6) + 4(-2) = -2$ (charge of the ion).

## Summary

The oxidation number is a concept used to describe the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) or reduction (gain of electrons) of an atom in a compound. It is crucial for understanding redox reactions. By following a set of rules, we can assign oxidation numbers to elements in compounds, which helps in balancing redox reactions and identifying the changes in oxidation states.

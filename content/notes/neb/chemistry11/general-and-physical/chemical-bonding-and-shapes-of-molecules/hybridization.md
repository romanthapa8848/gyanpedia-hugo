# Hybridization Involving s and p Orbitals Only

---

## Introduction to Hybridization

**Hybridization** is the process in which atomic orbitals mix to form new hybrid orbitals. These hybrid orbitals are used to form covalent bonds with other atoms. When hybridization involves only s and p orbitals, the result is a set of hybrid orbitals that have specific orientations and bond angles. This concept helps explain the shapes and bond angles in molecules.

## Types of Hybridization Involving s and p Orbitals

1. **sp Hybridization**:

   - Involves one **s orbital** and one **p orbital** from the same atom.
   - Forms **two sp hybrid orbitals** that are oriented in a **linear** arrangement, resulting in a bond angle of **180°**.
   - **Example**: BeCl₂, C₂H₂.

2. **sp² Hybridization**:

   - Involves one **s orbital** and two **p orbitals** from the same atom.
   - Forms **three sp² hybrid orbitals** that are oriented in a **trigonal planar** arrangement, with bond angles of **120°**.
   - **Example**: BF₃, C₂H₄.

3. **sp³ Hybridization**:
   - Involves one **s orbital** and three **p orbitals** from the same atom.
   - Forms **four sp³ hybrid orbitals** that are oriented in a **tetrahedral** arrangement, with bond angles of **109.5°**.
   - **Example**: CH₄, NH₃ (for the central atom in the molecule).

## Concept of Hybridization in Bond Formation

In each of these hybridizations, the hybrid orbitals are used to form covalent bonds with other atoms. The number of hybrid orbitals formed is equal to the number of atomic orbitals mixed. Hybrid orbitals have specific geometrical arrangements that minimize electron repulsion, leading to stable molecular shapes.

- **sp hybridization** leads to a **linear** shape.
- **sp² hybridization** leads to a **trigonal planar** shape.
- **sp³ hybridization** leads to a **tetrahedral** shape.

## Summary

Hybridization involving only **s** and **p** orbitals helps explain the molecular geometry and bond angles in many molecules. The process involves the mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals, which are oriented in specific directions to minimize electron repulsion. This theory is essential in understanding the bonding and shape of molecules.

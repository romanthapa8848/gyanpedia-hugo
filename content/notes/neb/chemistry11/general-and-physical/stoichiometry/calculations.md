# Calculations Based on Mole Concept

The **mole concept** allows chemists to relate mass, volume, and number of particles in a quantitative way. Using Avogadro's number and molar mass, we can perform calculations to determine the amount of substances involved in a chemical reaction or contained in a sample.

## Key Calculations

### 1. Calculating Moles from Mass

The number of moles, $n$, is found by dividing the mass of a substance by its molar mass ($M$):

$$
n = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}}
$$

### 2. Calculating Mass from Moles

To find the mass of a substance when moles are known:

$$
\text{Mass} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar Mass}
$$

### 3. Calculating Volume of Gas at STP

At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters:

$$
\text{Volume of gas (at STP)} = \text{Moles} \times 22.4 \, \text{L}
$$

### 4. Calculating Number of Particles

The number of particles (atoms, molecules, ions) is calculated by multiplying the moles by Avogadro's number, $6.022 \times 10^{23}$:

$$
\text{Number of particles} = \text{Moles} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}
$$

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Finding Moles from Mass

If you have 18 grams of water (H₂O), how many moles of water is this?

1. **Molar mass of H₂O**: $18 \, \text{g/mol}$
2. **Moles**:
   $$
   n = \frac{18 \, \text{g}}{18 \, \text{g/mol}} = 1 \, \text{mol}
   $$

### Example 2: Finding Mass from Moles

If you have 2 moles of sodium chloride (NaCl), with a molar mass of 58.5 g/mol, what is the mass?

$$
\text{Mass} = 2 \, \text{mol} \times 58.5 \, \text{g/mol} = 117 \, \text{g}
$$

### Example 3: Finding Volume of Gas at STP

How much volume would 3 moles of oxygen gas (O₂) occupy at STP?

$$
\text{Volume} = 3 \, \text{mol} \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 67.2 \, \text{L}
$$

### Example 4: Finding Number of Particles

How many molecules are in 0.25 moles of carbon dioxide (CO₂)?

$$
\text{Number of molecules} = 0.25 \, \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 1.5055 \times 10^{23} \text{ molecules}
$$

## Summary

- **Moles** can be calculated from mass or vice versa using molar mass.
- **Volume of gas** at STP can be found by multiplying moles by 22.4 L.
- **Number of particles** is found by multiplying moles by Avogadro's number ($6.022 \times 10^{23}$).

## FAQs

### 1. How do you find the number of moles from a given mass?

Divide the mass of the substance by its molar mass:

$$
n = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}}
$$

### 2. What is the volume of one mole of any gas at STP?

At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.

### 3. How is the number of particles related to moles?

The number of particles is obtained by multiplying moles by Avogadro’s number ($6.022 \times 10^{23}$).

### 4. What is Avogadro’s number?

Avogadro’s number, $6.022 \times 10^{23}$, is the number of particles in one mole of any substance.

### 5. How do you calculate the mass from the number of moles?

Multiply the number of moles by the molar mass:

$$
\text{Mass} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar Mass}
$$

### 6. Can the mole concept be applied to any substance?

Yes, the mole concept applies universally to elements, compounds, and gases.

### 7. How do you convert between mass and particles?

First, find the number of moles using the mass, then multiply by Avogadro's number to get particles.

### 8. What is the molar volume of a gas?

The molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.4 L for 1 mole.

### 9. How do you calculate the volume of gas if not at STP?

For non-STP conditions, use the ideal gas equation:

$$
PV = nRT
$$

### 10. What does molar mass represent?

Molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance, expressed in g/mol.

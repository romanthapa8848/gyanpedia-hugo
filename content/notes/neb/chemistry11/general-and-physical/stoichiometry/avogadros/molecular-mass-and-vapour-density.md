# Molecular Mass and Vapour Density

**Molecular mass** is the mass of a molecule, calculated by summing the atomic masses of all atoms in the molecule. It is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), where 1 amu is defined as one-twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

**Vapour density** (VD) is a property that indicates the density of a gas or vapor compared to hydrogen. It helps determine molecular mass because there is a direct relation between the molecular mass and vapour density of a gas.

The relationship between molecular mass and vapour density is given by:

$$
\text{Molecular Mass} = 2 \times \text{Vapour Density}
$$

This formula is derived from Avogadro’s hypothesis, which states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules.

## Explanation of Key Concepts

1. **Molecular Mass**: The molecular mass of a compound is calculated by adding the atomic masses of each atom in the molecular formula. For example, the molecular mass of $H_2O$ is:

   $$
   (2 \times 1) + (1 \times 16) = 18 \text{ amu}
   $$

2. **Vapour Density (VD)**: Vapour density is a measure of the density of a vapor compared to hydrogen under the same conditions. It can be calculated as:

   $$
   \text{Vapour Density} = \frac{\text{Mass of a certain volume of gas}}{\text{Mass of the same volume of hydrogen}}
   $$

3. **Relation Between Molecular Mass and Vapour Density**: By using the formula $ \text{Molecular Mass} = 2 \times \text{Vapour Density} $, we can find the molecular mass if the vapour density is known.

### Example Calculation

Suppose the vapour density of ammonia ($NH_3$) is 8.5. Using the relation, we can calculate the molecular mass of ammonia:

$$
\text{Molecular Mass} = 2 \times 8.5 = 17 \text{ amu}
$$

## Summary

- **Molecular Mass** is the total mass of all atoms in a molecule, measured in amu.
- **Vapour Density** is a measure of how dense a gas or vapor is compared to hydrogen.
- The relationship between molecular mass and vapour density is:
  $$
  \text{Molecular Mass} = 2 \times \text{Vapour Density}
  $$

This relationship simplifies the process of determining molecular masses for gases when vapour density is known.

## FAQs

### 1. What is molecular mass?

Molecular mass is the mass of a molecule, calculated by summing the atomic masses of all atoms in the molecular formula.

### 2. How is molecular mass measured?

Molecular mass is measured in atomic mass units (amu), with 1 amu defined as one-twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

### 3. What is vapour density?

Vapour density is a measure of how dense a gas is compared to hydrogen under the same conditions of temperature and pressure.

### 4. How do you calculate molecular mass from vapour density?

Molecular mass can be calculated from vapour density using the formula:

$$
\text{Molecular Mass} = 2 \times \text{Vapour Density}
$$

### 5. Why is vapour density measured relative to hydrogen?

Hydrogen is the lightest gas, and its use as a reference simplifies comparisons and calculations for other gases.

### 6. What is the molecular mass of a compound with a vapour density of 10?

Using the formula $ \text{Molecular Mass} = 2 \times \text{Vapour Density} $:

$$
\text{Molecular Mass} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ amu}
$$

### 7. Can vapour density be negative?

No, vapour density is always positive because it represents a physical mass comparison.

### 8. How does Avogadro’s hypothesis relate to molecular mass?

Avogadro’s hypothesis allows us to conclude that equal volumes of gases contain equal numbers of molecules, helping us relate vapour density to molecular mass.

### 9. Why is molecular mass important?

Molecular mass is essential in stoichiometry and chemical reactions to determine the proportions and quantities of compounds.

### 10. Is molecular mass the same as molar mass?

Molecular mass is measured in amu per molecule, while molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance, measured in grams per mole (g/mol).

# Mole and Its Relation with Mass, Volume, and Number of Particles

The **mole** is a fundamental unit in chemistry used to express the amount of substance. It is defined as the amount of a substance that contains exactly $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.). This number, known as **Avogadro’s number**, is the bridge between the atomic scale and the macroscopic scale in chemistry.

## Key Concepts

1. **Mole and Mass**:
   The mass of one mole of a substance is equal to its molar mass (in grams per mole, g/mol). For example:

   - The molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately 18 g/mol.
   - If we have 1 mole of water, its mass will be 18 g.

   The relationship can be expressed as:

   $$
   \text{Mass} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar Mass}
   $$

2. **Mole and Volume (for Gases)**:
   Under standard temperature and pressure (STP: 0°C and 1 atm), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters. This is known as **molar volume** of a gas at STP.

   The relationship is:

   $$
   \text{Volume of gas at STP} = \text{Moles} \times 22.4 \, \text{L}
   $$

3. **Mole and Number of Particles**:
   One mole of any substance contains $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles (atoms, molecules, or ions), according to Avogadro's number.

   The formula for the number of particles is:

   $$
   \text{Number of particles} = \text{Moles} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}
   $$

## Example Calculations

### 1. Calculating Mass

If we have 2 moles of sodium chloride (NaCl), with a molar mass of 58.5 g/mol, the mass is:

$$
\text{Mass} = 2 \times 58.5 = 117 \text{ g}
$$

### 2. Calculating Volume (for Gases)

If we have 3 moles of oxygen gas (O₂) at STP, the volume is:

$$
\text{Volume} = 3 \times 22.4 = 67.2 \text{ L}
$$

### 3. Calculating Number of Particles

If we have 0.5 moles of water (H₂O) molecules, the number of molecules is:

$$
\text{Number of molecules} = 0.5 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 3.011 \times 10^{23} \text{ molecules}
$$

## Summary

- The mole links the microscopic world (atoms, molecules) to the macroscopic world (grams, liters).
- **Mass** of a substance (in grams) is obtained by multiplying the number of moles by its molar mass.
- **Volume** of a gas at STP is obtained by multiplying the number of moles by 22.4 L.
- **Number of Particles** is calculated by multiplying moles by Avogadro's number.

## FAQs

### 1. What is a mole in chemistry?

A mole is a unit representing $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles of a substance. It allows chemists to count atoms, molecules, and ions.

### 2. How is mole related to mass?

The mass of a substance (in grams) is the product of the moles and the molar mass of the substance.

### 3. What is molar volume?

Molar volume is the volume occupied by one mole of any gas at STP, which is 22.4 L.

### 4. How can we calculate the number of particles in a sample?

The number of particles is calculated by multiplying the moles by Avogadro's number ($6.022 \times 10^{23}$).

### 5. Does 1 mole of all gases occupy the same volume?

Yes, at STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.

### 6. What is Avogadro's number?

Avogadro’s number is $6.022 \times 10^{23}$, representing the number of particles in one mole.

### 7. How do you find moles if you know the mass?

To find moles, divide the mass by the molar mass of the substance:

$$
\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}}
$$

### 8. Can molar volume be used for solids and liquids?

No, molar volume of 22.4 L applies only to gases at STP.

### 9. How do you calculate the volume of a gas not at STP?

For non-STP conditions, use the ideal gas law: $PV = nRT$.

### 10. Why is the mole concept important?

The mole concept simplifies chemical calculations by relating macroscopic and atomic quantities.

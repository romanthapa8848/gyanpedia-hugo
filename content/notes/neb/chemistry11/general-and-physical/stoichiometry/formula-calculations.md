# Calculation of Empirical and Molecular Formula from % Composition

The **empirical formula** represents the simplest whole-number ratio of elements in a compound, while the **molecular formula** shows the actual number of atoms of each element in the compound.

To calculate these formulas from the percentage composition, follow these steps:

## Steps to Calculate the Empirical Formula

1. **Assume 100 g of the compound**: This allows you to directly use the percentage composition as grams of each element.
2. **Convert the mass of each element to moles**: Use the atomic masses of the elements to convert the masses into moles:
   $$
   \text{Moles of element} = \frac{\text{Mass of element (g)}}{\text{Atomic mass (g/mol)}}
   $$
3. **Find the simplest mole ratio**: Divide all the moles by the smallest number of moles calculated in step 2.
4. **Round to the nearest whole number**: If necessary, multiply the ratios to get whole numbers.
5. **Write the empirical formula**: The empirical formula will have the elements in the ratio obtained.

## Steps to Calculate the Molecular Formula

1. **Calculate the empirical formula mass**: Add the atomic masses of the elements in the empirical formula.
2. **Find the molecular formula mass**: This is usually given in the problem or can be determined experimentally.
3. **Calculate the ratio of the molecular formula mass to the empirical formula mass**:
   $$
   n = \frac{\text{Molecular formula mass}}{\text{Empirical formula mass}}
   $$
4. **Multiply the empirical formula by n**: This gives the molecular formula.

## Example Calculation

Consider a compound with the following percentage composition:

- Carbon (C): 40.0%
- Hydrogen (H): 6.7%
- Oxygen (O): 53.3%

### Step 1: Assume 100 g of the compound

- Mass of Carbon (C) = 40.0 g
- Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 6.7 g
- Mass of Oxygen (O) = 53.3 g

### Step 2: Convert masses to moles

- Moles of Carbon:
  $$
  \frac{40.0}{12.0} = 3.33 \text{ mol}
  $$
- Moles of Hydrogen:
  $$
  \frac{6.7}{1.0} = 6.7 \text{ mol}
  $$
- Moles of Oxygen:
  $$
  \frac{53.3}{16.0} = 3.33 \text{ mol}
  $$

### Step 3: Find the simplest ratio

- The smallest number of moles is 3.33, so divide all mole values by 3.33:
  - Carbon: $$
  \frac{3.33}{3.33} = 1
  $$
  - Hydrogen: $$
  \frac{6.7}{3.33} = 2
  $$
  - Oxygen: $$
  \frac{3.33}{3.33} = 1
  $$

Thus, the empirical formula is **CH₂O**.

### Step 4: Calculate the molecular formula

Suppose the molecular formula mass is 180 g/mol, and the empirical formula mass of CH₂O is:

$$
(12.0) + (2.0) + (16.0) = 30.0 \text{ g/mol}
$$

Calculate the ratio:

$$
n = \frac{180}{30} = 6
$$

Thus, the molecular formula is:

$$
(\text{CH}_2\text{O})_6 = \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6
$$

So, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₆H₁₂O₆**.

## FAQs

### 1. What is an empirical formula?

An empirical formula represents the simplest whole-number ratio of elements in a compound.

### 2. How do you calculate the empirical formula from percentage composition?

Convert the percentage composition to mass, then to moles, and finally find the simplest mole ratio to determine the empirical formula.

### 3. What is the difference between empirical and molecular formula?

The empirical formula shows the simplest ratio of elements, while the molecular formula shows the exact number of atoms of each element in the molecule.

### 4. Can the empirical and molecular formula be the same?

Yes, if the compound already has the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms, the empirical and molecular formula will be identical.

### 5. Why do we assume 100 g of the compound in calculations?

Assuming 100 g simplifies the calculation, as the percentage composition can be directly interpreted as grams of each element.

### 6. How do you calculate the molecular formula from the empirical formula?

First, calculate the empirical formula mass, then divide the molecular formula mass by the empirical formula mass, and multiply the empirical formula by the result.

### 7. What is the molecular formula of glucose, given that its empirical formula is CH₂O?

The molecular formula of glucose is **C₆H₁₂O₆**, which is 6 times the empirical formula.

### 8. What should you do if the mole ratios are not whole numbers?

If the mole ratios are close to whole numbers but not exactly, multiply all the ratios by the same factor to get whole numbers.

### 9. Can empirical formulas have fractions?

Yes, in some cases, empirical formulas might have fractional ratios, but these are multiplied by a common factor to give whole numbers.

### 10. Why is the empirical formula important?

The empirical formula provides insight into the basic structure of a compound, which is useful in determining chemical properties and behaviors.

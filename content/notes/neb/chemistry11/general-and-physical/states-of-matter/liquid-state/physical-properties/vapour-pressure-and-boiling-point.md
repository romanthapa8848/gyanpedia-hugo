# Vapour Pressure and Boiling Point

---

## Introduction

**Vapour pressure** is the pressure exerted by a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid at a given temperature. **Boiling point** is the temperature at which a liquid's vapour pressure equals the external atmospheric pressure, causing the liquid to turn into a gas. Understanding these concepts is essential for studying phase changes, the behavior of liquids, and factors affecting boiling points.

## Vapour Pressure

### Definition

Vapour pressure is the pressure exerted by molecules of a liquid when they escape into the vapor phase and reach equilibrium with the liquid. The rate of evaporation equals the rate of condensation at this equilibrium.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Depends on Temperature**: Vapour pressure increases with temperature as more molecules have enough kinetic energy to escape the liquid.
2. **Volatility**: Substances with high vapour pressures at a given temperature are called volatile and tend to evaporate quickly.

### Factors Affecting Vapour Pressure

1. **Temperature**: Higher temperature increases vapour pressure.
2. **Intermolecular Forces**: Liquids with weaker intermolecular forces have higher vapour pressures.

## Boiling Point

### Definition

The boiling point is the temperature at which a liquid’s vapour pressure equals the external atmospheric pressure, allowing the liquid to turn into vapor.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Depends on Pressure**: Boiling point decreases at lower pressures (e.g., at high altitudes) and increases at higher pressures.
2. **Constant for Pure Substances**: For a given pressure, pure substances have a specific boiling point, which is an intrinsic property.

### Factors Affecting Boiling Point

1. **Atmospheric Pressure**: Higher atmospheric pressure increases boiling point, while lower atmospheric pressure decreases it.
2. **Intermolecular Forces**: Stronger intermolecular forces increase the boiling point, as more energy is required to vaporize the liquid.

## Comparison Table: Vapour Pressure vs. Boiling Point

| Property                  | Vapour Pressure                          | Boiling Point                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**            | Pressure exerted by vapor in equilibrium | Temperature where vapour pressure equals atmospheric pressure |
| **Effect of Temperature** | Increases with temperature               | Specific temperature for each pressure                        |
| **Dependency**            | Temperature and intermolecular forces    | Atmospheric pressure and intermolecular forces                |
| **Examples**              | High for volatile liquids like alcohol   | Water boils at 100°C at sea level                             |

## Summary

Vapour pressure and boiling point are closely related properties that describe how a liquid transitions to a gas. Vapour pressure increases with temperature and is characteristic of each liquid based on its intermolecular forces. The boiling point, on the other hand, depends on both vapour pressure and external pressure and is the temperature at which a liquid boils.

## FAQs

### 1. What is vapour pressure?

Vapour pressure is the pressure exerted by the vapor of a liquid in equilibrium with its liquid phase at a given temperature.

### 2. How does vapour pressure change with temperature?

As temperature increases, vapour pressure also increases.

### 3. What is the boiling point?

The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapour pressure of a liquid equals the external atmospheric pressure.

### 4. Why does water boil at lower temperatures at high altitudes?

At high altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower, so water reaches boiling point at a lower temperature.

### 5. How do intermolecular forces affect boiling point?

Liquids with stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to boil, resulting in a higher boiling point.

### 6. What happens to vapour pressure when the temperature of a liquid decreases?

Vapour pressure decreases as temperature decreases.

### 7. Which factor directly affects both vapour pressure and boiling point?

Intermolecular forces directly affect both vapour pressure and boiling point.

### 8. Which of the following statements is TRUE about volatile liquids?

Volatile liquids have high vapour pressures at a given temperature.

### 9. What is the primary reason that water boils at 100°C at sea level?

Water's vapour pressure equals atmospheric pressure at 100°C, leading to boiling.

### 10. When a liquid reaches its boiling point, what occurs within the liquid?

Bubbles of vapor form throughout the liquid, leading to rapid phase transition.

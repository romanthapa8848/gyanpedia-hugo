# Deviation of Real Gas from Ideality

---

## Introduction

Real gases do not behave exactly as ideal gases, especially under high pressure or low temperature conditions. The **Ideal Gas Law** assumes no interactions between gas molecules and that the volume of gas molecules is negligible. However, real gases have intermolecular forces, and the volume occupied by gas molecules themselves cannot be ignored under certain conditions, leading to deviations from ideal behavior.

## Reasons for Deviation from Ideal Gas Behavior

1. **Intermolecular Forces**:
   In ideal gases, it is assumed that gas molecules do not exert any forces on one another. However, in real gases, there are attractive and repulsive forces between molecules, which affect their behavior. These forces become particularly significant under conditions of high pressure (when molecules are close together) and low temperature (when molecules move slower).

   - **Attractive Forces**: These forces cause real gas molecules to be pulled towards each other, reducing the pressure exerted on the walls of the container compared to an ideal gas.
   - **Repulsive Forces**: At very high pressures, molecules are forced closer together, and repulsive forces start to dominate, which increases the pressure.

2. **Finite Volume of Molecules**:
   In the Ideal Gas Law, gas molecules are treated as point particles, meaning their volume is considered negligible. However, real gas molecules occupy a finite volume. At high pressures, the volume of the gas molecules themselves becomes significant, and the gas behaves less ideally.

## Van der Waals Equation of State

To account for the deviation of real gases from ideal behavior, the **Van der Waals equation** modifies the Ideal Gas Law by introducing two constants, **a** and **b**, which account for intermolecular forces and the finite volume of molecules, respectively.

The **Van der Waals equation** is given by:

$$
\left( P + \frac{a}{V^2} \right) \left( V - b \right) = nRT
$$

Where:

- **P** is the pressure of the gas,
- **V** is the volume of the gas,
- **n** is the number of moles of gas,
- **R** is the universal gas constant,
- **T** is the temperature in Kelvin,
- **a** is a constant that accounts for the attractive forces between molecules,
- **b** is a constant that accounts for the finite volume of gas molecules.

## Compressibility Factor (Z)

The **compressibility factor** is used to quantify the deviation of a real gas from ideal behavior. It is defined as:

$$
Z = \frac{P V_m}{R T}
$$

Where:

- **Z** is the compressibility factor,
- **P** is the pressure,
- **V_m** is the molar volume of the gas,
- **R** is the universal gas constant,
- **T** is the temperature.

For an ideal gas, the compressibility factor **Z = 1**. For real gases:

- **Z > 1** indicates that the gas is less compressible than an ideal gas, typically due to repulsive intermolecular forces.
- **Z < 1** indicates that the gas is more compressible than an ideal gas, typically due to attractive intermolecular forces.

## Conditions Under Which Real Gases Deviate from Ideal Behavior

1. **High Pressure**:
   At high pressure, the volume of the gas molecules becomes significant compared to the container volume, leading to deviation from ideal behavior. The repulsive forces between molecules also become important at high pressures.

2. **Low Temperature**:
   At low temperatures, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules decreases, and intermolecular forces, especially attractive forces, become more significant. This causes the gas to deviate from ideal behavior by reducing the pressure exerted by the gas on the walls of the container.

3. **High Density**:
   High density leads to more frequent molecular interactions, which further increases the deviation from ideal behavior. Real gases at high density exhibit stronger intermolecular attractions and repulsive forces.

4. **Polar Gases**:
   Polar molecules with significant dipole-dipole interactions deviate more from ideal behavior because of the stronger intermolecular forces.

## Summary

Real gases deviate from ideal gas behavior due to intermolecular forces and the finite volume of gas molecules. The **Van der Waals equation** provides a more accurate description of real gases, incorporating these factors. The **compressibility factor** is also used to quantify the deviation from ideality. Real gases behave more ideally at low pressure and high temperature, where intermolecular interactions are minimized.

## FAQs

### 1. What causes real gases to deviate from ideal behavior?

Real gases deviate from ideal behavior due to intermolecular forces (attractive and repulsive) and the finite volume of gas molecules.

### 2. How does the Van der Waals equation modify the Ideal Gas Law?

The Van der Waals equation introduces two constants, **a** and **b**, to account for intermolecular forces and the finite volume of gas molecules, respectively.

### 3. What is the compressibility factor?

The compressibility factor (Z) quantifies the deviation of a real gas from ideal behavior, with values greater than 1 indicating less compressibility and values less than 1 indicating more compressibility.

### 4. How do attractive forces affect real gas behavior?

Attractive forces reduce the pressure exerted by the gas on the container walls, causing real gases to behave less ideally.

### 5. How do repulsive forces affect real gas behavior?

Repulsive forces increase the pressure of the gas, especially at high densities or high pressures, causing real gases to deviate from ideal behavior.

### 6. When do real gases behave most ideally?

Real gases behave most ideally at low pressures and high temperatures, where intermolecular forces are minimized, and the volume of the gas molecules is negligible.

### 7. What is the role of the **a** constant in the Van der Waals equation?

The **a** constant in the Van der Waals equation accounts for the attractive forces between gas molecules.

### 8. What is the role of the **b** constant in the Van der Waals equation?

The **b** constant in the Van der Waals equation accounts for the finite volume of gas molecules.

### 9. How does the compressibility factor help us understand real gases?

The compressibility factor helps determine whether a gas behaves more or less compressible than an ideal gas, based on the sign of the deviation from ideality.

### 10. What happens to the compressibility factor of a gas at high pressure?

At high pressure, the compressibility factor typically decreases, indicating that the gas is more compressible than an ideal gas due to stronger intermolecular forces.

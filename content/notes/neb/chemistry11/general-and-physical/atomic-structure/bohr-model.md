# Postulates of Bohr’s Atomic Model and Its Applications

Bohr’s atomic model was proposed in 1913 by Niels Bohr to address the limitations of Rutherford's atomic model. The model explained the stability of the atom and the discrete nature of atomic spectra. Bohr introduced the concept of **quantized orbits** or energy levels, which revolutionized the understanding of atomic structure.

## Postulates of Bohr's Atomic Model

Bohr’s model is based on the following **three postulates**:

### 1. **Electron Orbits or Energy Levels**

Bohr proposed that electrons revolve in stable, circular orbits around the nucleus without emitting radiation. These orbits are also called **stationary orbits** or **energy levels**. An electron in one of these orbits does not lose energy, and thus, it does not spiral inward toward the nucleus.

### 2. **Quantization of Angular Momentum**

Bohr postulated that the angular momentum of an electron in these orbits is quantized. It means that the angular momentum of an electron in the $n$-th orbit is an integral multiple of $\hbar$ (reduced Planck’s constant):

$$
L = n \hbar = n \frac{h}{2\pi}
$$

Where:

- $L$ is the angular momentum of the electron
- $n$ is a positive integer called the **principal quantum number**
- $h$ is Planck’s constant

This quantization leads to the concept of discrete energy levels for electrons.

### 3. **Energy Emission or Absorption**

When an electron moves from a higher energy orbit to a lower energy orbit, energy is emitted in the form of **photons**. The energy of the photon is equal to the difference in energy between the two orbits:

$$
\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = h \nu
$$

Where:

- $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the energies of the initial and final orbits
- $h$ is Planck’s constant
- $\nu$ is the frequency of the emitted photon

Similarly, when an electron absorbs energy, it jumps to a higher orbit.

## Applications of Bohr’s Atomic Model

Bohr’s model successfully explained several phenomena that could not be addressed by Rutherford’s model, particularly the behavior of hydrogen atoms and atomic spectra.

### 1. **Explanation of Hydrogen Spectrum**

One of the most significant successes of Bohr’s model was its explanation of the **hydrogen spectrum**. Bohr’s quantized orbits explained why hydrogen emitted light at discrete wavelengths when it was excited. These wavelengths corresponded to transitions between different energy levels.

For a hydrogen atom, the energy levels are given by the formula:

$$
E_n = - \frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}
$$

Where:

- $E_n$ is the energy of the $n$-th energy level
- $n$ is the principal quantum number (1, 2, 3,...)

The difference in energy levels ($E_2 - E_1$) corresponds to the frequency of the emitted photon, which produces the **Balmer series** of visible spectral lines in the hydrogen atom.

### 2. **Bohr’s Model and the Stability of the Atom**

Bohr’s model resolved the issue of the **stability of the atom**. In Rutherford’s model, electrons were predicted to spiral into the nucleus due to the emission of radiation. However, Bohr showed that electrons in certain stable orbits (quantized orbits) do not lose energy, and thus, atoms remain stable.

### 3. **Prediction of Spectral Lines**

Bohr’s model accurately predicted the wavelengths of spectral lines for hydrogen. By using the formula for the energy of orbits and the energy difference between two orbits, Bohr was able to predict the wavelengths of light emitted or absorbed when an electron transitions between these orbits. The result was the **Balmer series** for visible light and other series for ultraviolet and infrared light.

## Summary

Bohr’s atomic model introduced the concept of quantized electron orbits, explaining the stability of atoms and the discrete nature of atomic spectra. It successfully accounted for the hydrogen spectrum and the behavior of electrons in atoms, marking a significant advancement in atomic theory. The model laid the groundwork for later developments in quantum mechanics, although it had limitations in explaining atoms with more than one electron.

## FAQs

### 1. What are the postulates of Bohr's atomic model?

The postulates are:

1. Electrons move in stable, circular orbits without emitting radiation.
2. The angular momentum of an electron is quantized.
3. Electrons emit or absorb energy when they jump between orbits.

### 2. How does Bohr’s model explain the hydrogen spectrum?

Bohr’s model explains that electrons in hydrogen atoms move between discrete energy levels. The energy difference between these levels corresponds to the emitted or absorbed light, which creates the spectral lines.

### 3. What is the significance of quantized angular momentum in Bohr's model?

Quantized angular momentum allows electrons to remain in stable orbits and prevents them from losing energy continuously, which would cause them to spiral into the nucleus.

### 4. How does Bohr’s model differ from Rutherford’s model?

Bohr’s model introduced quantized energy levels for electrons, explaining the stability of atoms and the discrete nature of atomic spectra, while Rutherford’s model had no explanation for these phenomena.

### 5. What is the energy formula for the electron in a hydrogen atom according to Bohr’s model?

The energy formula for the $n$-th orbit in a hydrogen atom is:

$$
E_n = - \frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}
$$

### 6. Why is Bohr’s model important for atomic theory?

Bohr’s model introduced the concept of quantized energy levels and provided a successful explanation for the hydrogen spectrum, which was a significant advancement in atomic theory.

### 7. Can Bohr’s model explain the spectra of atoms other than hydrogen?

No, Bohr’s model was specifically developed for hydrogen and could not explain the spectra of multi-electron atoms.

### 8. What is the principal quantum number $n$ in Bohr's model?

The principal quantum number $n$ indicates the energy level or orbit in which an electron resides. It is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...).

### 9. How does Bohr’s model explain the stability of the atom?

Bohr’s model explains that electrons in specific orbits do not emit radiation, preventing them from spiraling into the nucleus, thus making the atom stable.

### 10. What is the significance of Bohr’s model in modern atomic theory?

Bohr’s model laid the foundation for the later development of quantum mechanics and the modern understanding of atomic structure.

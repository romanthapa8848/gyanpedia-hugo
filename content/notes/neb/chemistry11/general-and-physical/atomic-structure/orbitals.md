# Orbitals and Shape of s and p Orbitals

In an atom, electrons are found in orbitals, which are regions of space around the nucleus where the probability of finding an electron is high. Each orbital corresponds to a specific **quantum number** and has a characteristic shape.

### 1. s Orbitals

The **s orbital** is spherical in shape. The s orbitals are the simplest type of orbitals and are present in every energy level, starting from $n = 1$.

- **Shape**: The s orbital is spherical, meaning the electron cloud is evenly distributed in all directions around the nucleus.
- **Nodes**: An s orbital has a **radial node** at a certain distance from the nucleus. As $n$ increases, the number of nodes increases.
- **Electron Density**: The probability of finding the electron is highest near the nucleus and decreases as you move farther away, forming a spherical distribution.

For example, the $1s$ orbital is the closest to the nucleus, and as $n$ increases, the size of the orbital increases.

### 2. p Orbitals

The **p orbitals** are **dumbbell-shaped** and are present in energy levels starting from $n = 2$. There are three p orbitals for each energy level with $n \geq 2$, each corresponding to different orientations in space.

- **Shape**: The p orbitals are dumbbell-shaped, with the electron cloud having two lobes on opposite sides of the nucleus.
- **Orientation**: There are three p orbitals for each energy level, oriented along the **x**, **y**, and **z** axes, named $p_x$, $p_y$, and $p_z$.
- **Nodes**: The p orbitals have a node at the nucleus, where the probability of finding the electron is zero. As $n$ increases, the p orbitals become larger and have more nodes.

For example, the $2p$ orbitals have one node and extend further from the nucleus compared to the $2s$ orbital.

## Comparison of s and p Orbitals

| Property               | s Orbital                       | p Orbital                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Shape**              | Spherical                       | Dumbbell-shaped                      |
| **Number of Orbitals** | 1 per energy level              | 3 per energy level                   |
| **Orientation**        | No specific orientation         | Oriented along x, y, z axes          |
| **Nodes**              | Radial nodes (increases with n) | Angular node at the nucleus          |
| **Electron Density**   | Highest near the nucleus        | Two lobes with a node at the nucleus |
| **Energy Level**       | Present in all energy levels    | Present from $n = 2$ onwards         |

## Summary

- The **s orbital** is spherical and exists in all energy levels. It has no angular node and has a **spherical electron density**.
- The **p orbitals** are dumbbell-shaped and exist starting from energy level $n = 2$. There are three p orbitals, each oriented along different axes, and each with one angular node.

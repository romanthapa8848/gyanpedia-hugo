# Classification of Elements into Groups, Periods, and Blocks

---

## Groups

In the modern periodic table, the elements are arranged into **18 vertical columns** known as **groups**. Elements in the same group share similar chemical properties because they have the same number of valence electrons.

- **Group 1 (Alkali Metals)**: These elements have one electron in their outermost shell. Examples include sodium (Na), potassium (K), etc.
- **Group 2 (Alkaline Earth Metals)**: These elements have two electrons in their outermost shell. Examples include magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), etc.
- **Group 17 (Halogens)**: These elements have seven electrons in their outermost shell. Examples include fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), etc.
- **Group 18 (Noble Gases)**: These elements have a full outer shell of electrons, making them chemically inert. Examples include helium (He), neon (Ne), etc.

## Periods

The **horizontal rows** in the periodic table are known as **periods**. There are **7 periods** in the modern periodic table. Each period represents the filling of a new electron shell.

- **Period 1**: Contains just two elements—hydrogen (H) and helium (He)—which fill the first electron shell.
- **Period 2**: Contains elements like lithium (Li) and neon (Ne), filling the second electron shell.
- **Period 3**: Contains elements like sodium (Na) and argon (Ar), filling the third electron shell.
- The trend continues until **Period 7**, which contains heavier elements like francium (Fr) and oganesson (Og).

As you move across a period from left to right, the elements change gradually from metals to nonmetals, showing a periodicity in their properties.

## Blocks

The periodic table is also divided into **blocks** based on the type of orbitals being filled with electrons. These blocks are:

- **s-block**: Consists of **Groups 1 and 2** (excluding hydrogen and helium) and helium. These elements have their outermost electrons in the **s orbital**.
  - Example: Lithium (Li), Sodium (Na).
- **p-block**: Consists of **Groups 13 to 18**. These elements have their outermost electrons in the **p orbital**.
  - Example: Carbon (C), Oxygen (O).
- **d-block**: Consists of the **transition metals** located in **Groups 3 to 12**. These elements have their outermost electrons in the **d orbital**.
  - Example: Iron (Fe), Copper (Cu).
- **f-block**: Consists of the **lanthanides and actinides**, located below the main body of the periodic table. These elements have their outermost electrons in the **f orbital**.
  - Example: Uranium (U), Neptunium (Np).

## Summary

- **Groups** are the vertical columns in the periodic table where elements have similar properties due to the same number of valence electrons.
- **Periods** are the horizontal rows where elements progressively fill electron shells.
- **Blocks** categorize elements based on the type of orbital they fill with electrons (s, p, d, f).

## FAQs

### 1. What are groups in the periodic table?

**Groups** are the vertical columns in the periodic table, where elements have similar chemical properties due to the same number of valence electrons.

### 2. How many periods are in the modern periodic table?

There are **7 periods** in the modern periodic table.

### 3. What do the periods in the periodic table represent?

Periods represent the filling of electron shells as we move from left to right across the table.

### 4. What are s-block elements?

**s-block elements** are those in **Groups 1 and 2**, and they have their outermost electrons in the s orbital.

### 5. What are p-block elements?

**p-block elements** are those in **Groups 13 to 18**, and they have their outermost electrons in the p orbital.

### 6. What are d-block elements?

**d-block elements**, also known as **transition metals**, are in **Groups 3 to 12**, and they have their outermost electrons in the d orbital.

### 7. What are f-block elements?

**f-block elements** are the **lanthanides and actinides**, and they have their outermost electrons in the f orbital.

### 8. What is the difference between a group and a period?

A **group** is a vertical column in the periodic table where elements have similar properties. A **period** is a horizontal row where elements show a gradual change in properties.

### 9. Why are noble gases placed in Group 18?

Noble gases have a **full outer shell** of electrons, making them chemically inert, which is why they are placed in Group 18.

### 10. How are elements classified in the periodic table?

Elements are classified into **groups** based on their similar chemical properties, into **periods** based on the electron shell they occupy, and into **blocks** based on the type of orbital they fill.

# Electron Affinity

## Introduction to Electron Affinity

**Electron Affinity (EA)** is defined as the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom in the gaseous state to form a negative ion. The process can be represented as:

$$
\text{X (g)} + e^- \rightarrow \text{X}^- (g)
$$

where **X** is the element and **e⁻** is the electron being added.

- **Electron affinity** values can be positive (exothermic) or negative (endothermic), but elements that release energy upon gaining an electron (typically nonmetals) have a **positive electron affinity** value.

## Factors Affecting Electron Affinity

1. **Atomic Size**: Smaller atoms have higher electron affinity as the added electron is closer to the nucleus and experiences a stronger attraction.
2. **Nuclear Charge**: A higher nuclear charge increases the electron affinity because the nucleus more strongly attracts the added electron.
3. **Electron Shielding**: Increased electron shielding (more inner shells) reduces effective nuclear attraction on the added electron, decreasing electron affinity.
4. **Electron Configuration**: Elements with stable electron configurations (like noble gases) have low or even negative electron affinities as they resist gaining additional electrons.

## Periodic Trends in Electron Affinity

1. **Across a Period**: Electron affinity generally increases from left to right across a period, as atomic size decreases and nuclear charge increases.
2. **Down a Group**: Electron affinity generally decreases down a group due to an increase in atomic size and electron shielding, which reduces the attraction between the nucleus and the added electron.

## Anomalies in Electron Affinity Trends

- Group 2 and Group 18 elements typically have low or negative electron affinities because their s-orbitals and p-orbitals, respectively, are fully filled, making them more stable and less likely to accept additional electrons.

## Summary

Electron affinity measures the energy change when an electron is added to an atom, often leading to a release of energy in nonmetals. This property follows periodic trends, increasing across a period and generally decreasing down a group, with notable exceptions due to electron configuration stability.

## FAQs

### 1. What is electron affinity?

Electron affinity is the energy change that occurs when an electron is added to an atom in the gaseous state.

### 2. Why does electron affinity increase across a period?

Across a period, atomic size decreases, and nuclear charge increases, leading to a higher attraction for the added electron.

### 3. Why does electron affinity decrease down a group?

Down a group, atomic size increases, and the attraction between the nucleus and the added electron weakens due to increased electron shielding.

### 4. Which elements have the highest electron affinity?

**Halogens** generally have the highest electron affinities because they are one electron short of a stable configuration.

### 5. Why do noble gases have low or negative electron affinities?

Noble gases have full valence shells, making them stable and unlikely to gain electrons.

### 6. What is a negative electron affinity?

A negative electron affinity indicates that energy is required (instead of released) to add an electron, as seen in elements with stable configurations.

### 7. How is electron affinity measured?

Electron affinity is measured using spectroscopic techniques, often through observing energy changes during electron attachment.

### 8. What is the electron affinity of oxygen compared to sulfur?

**Sulfur** has a slightly higher electron affinity than **oxygen** due to reduced electron repulsion in larger atoms.

### 9. Do metals generally have high or low electron affinities?

Metals usually have low electron affinities as they prefer losing electrons to form positive ions rather than gaining electrons.

### 10. What is the unit of electron affinity?

Electron affinity is generally measured in **kJ/mol**.

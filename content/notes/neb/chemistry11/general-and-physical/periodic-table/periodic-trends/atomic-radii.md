## What is Atomic Radius?

The **atomic radius** is the distance from the nucleus of an atom to the outermost shell of electrons. It is a measure of the "size" of an atom. However, since electrons do not have precise positions, atomic radius is often measured as the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms and then divided by two.

## Types of Atomic Radii

1. **Covalent Radius**: The atomic radius of an atom when it is covalently bonded with another atom. It is half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms bonded together.

2. **Metallic Radius**: The radius of an atom in a metallic lattice. It is half the distance between two adjacent atoms in a metallic lattice.

3. **Van der Waals Radius**: The distance between the centers of two non-bonded, adjacent atoms, typically observed in noble gases.

## Periodic Trend of Atomic Radius

### Across a Period

- **Trend**: Atomic radius decreases from left to right across a period.
- **Explanation**: As you move across a period, the number of protons and electrons increases, causing the effective nuclear charge to increase. This stronger nuclear charge pulls the electrons closer to the nucleus, resulting in a smaller atomic radius.

### Down a Group

- **Trend**: Atomic radius increases down a group.
- **Explanation**: As you move down a group, additional electron shells are added, increasing the distance between the nucleus and the outermost electrons. This additional distance and electron shielding effect cause the atomic radius to increase.

## Summary

The atomic radius of an element is influenced by its position in the periodic table. Across a period, atomic radius decreases due to increasing nuclear charge, while down a group, it increases because of additional electron shells. Understanding atomic radii helps predict chemical reactivity and bonding behavior in different elements.

## FAQs

### 1. What is atomic radius?

Atomic radius is the distance from the nucleus of an atom to its outermost shell of electrons.

### 2. How does atomic radius change across a period?

Atomic radius decreases from left to right across a period due to increased effective nuclear charge.

### 3. Why does atomic radius increase down a group?

Atomic radius increases down a group because additional electron shells increase the distance from the nucleus.

### 4. What is covalent radius?

Covalent radius is half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms in a covalent bond.

### 5. What is metallic radius?

Metallic radius is half the distance between two adjacent atoms in a metallic lattice.

### 6. What is Van der Waals radius?

Van der Waals radius is half the distance between two non-bonded atoms, typically measured in noble gases.

### 7. Why does atomic radius decrease across a period?

The atomic radius decreases across a period because of the increasing nuclear charge, which pulls electrons closer.

### 8. How does shielding affect atomic radius?

Electron shielding reduces the effective nuclear charge felt by outer electrons, increasing atomic radius.

### 9. What is effective nuclear charge?

Effective nuclear charge is the net charge experienced by electrons, accounting for electron shielding.

### 10. How does atomic radius affect reactivity?

In general, a larger atomic radius leads to higher reactivity in metals but lower reactivity in nonmetals.

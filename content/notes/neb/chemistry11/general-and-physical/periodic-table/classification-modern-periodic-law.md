# Modern Periodic Law and Modern Periodic Table

---

## Modern Periodic Law

The **Modern Periodic Law** states that:

> **"The properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic numbers."**

This law was proposed by **Henry Moseley** in 1913 after he discovered that the atomic number (not the atomic mass) is the fundamental property that determines the periodicity of elements. As a result, elements are arranged in increasing order of their atomic numbers in the periodic table.

## Modern Periodic Table

The **Modern Periodic Table** is a tabular arrangement of elements based on their **atomic number**. The elements are arranged in:

1. **Periods (Rows)**: There are 7 periods in the modern periodic table, each representing a different energy level (shell) for the electrons of the elements in that period.
2. **Groups (Columns)**: There are 18 groups in the periodic table. Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of valence electrons.

## Features of the Modern Periodic Table

1. **Elements in Periods**: Elements in a period show a gradual change in properties, such as from metals to nonmetals, as you move from left to right across the period.
2. **Elements in Groups**: Elements in the same group share similar chemical behaviors because they have the same number of valence electrons.
3. **Metals, Nonmetals, and Metalloids**:
   - **Metals** are on the left side and have properties like good conductivity, malleability, and ductility.
   - **Nonmetals** are on the right side and are poor conductors, with properties like brittleness and low melting points.
   - **Metalloids** lie along the dividing line and have properties intermediate between metals and nonmetals.
4. **Classification into Blocks**: The periodic table is divided into blocks (s, p, d, and f) based on the type of orbital that is being filled with electrons.

## Important Aspects of the Modern Periodic Table

- **Atomic Number**: It is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom, which defines the element.
- **Periodic Trends**: Various properties of elements exhibit trends across periods and groups, such as:
  - **Atomic radius**: Decreases across a period and increases down a group.
  - **Ionization energy**: Increases across a period and decreases down a group.
  - **Electronegativity**: Increases across a period and decreases down a group.

## Summary

The **Modern Periodic Law** brought a more systematic arrangement of elements based on atomic numbers. This arrangement leads to the identification of periodic trends and the grouping of elements into periods and groups based on shared properties. The periodic table is a crucial tool for understanding the relationships between different elements and predicting their chemical behavior.

## FAQs

### 1. **What is the Modern Periodic Law?**

The Modern Periodic Law states that the properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic numbers.

### 2. **Who proposed the Modern Periodic Law?**

The Modern Periodic Law was proposed by **Henry Moseley** in 1913.

### 3. **How many groups are there in the Modern Periodic Table?**

There are **18 groups** in the Modern Periodic Table.

### 4. **How many periods are there in the Modern Periodic Table?**

There are **7 periods** in the Modern Periodic Table.

### 5. **What is the basis for the arrangement of elements in the periodic table?**

The elements are arranged based on their **atomic number**, which is the number of protons in the nucleus.

### 6. **What are the different types of elements in the periodic table?**

The periodic table contains **metals**, **nonmetals**, and **metalloids**. These elements have varying physical and chemical properties.

### 7. **What are the trends across periods in the periodic table?**

Across periods, properties such as **atomic radius**, **ionization energy**, and **electronegativity** show specific trends. Atomic radius decreases across a period, while ionization energy and electronegativity increase.

### 8. **How does the atomic radius change across a period?**

The **atomic radius decreases** as you move from left to right across a period due to the increasing positive charge in the nucleus, which pulls electrons closer.

### 9. **What is the significance of groups in the periodic table?**

Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of **valence electrons**.

### 10. **What is the maximum number of electrons that can occupy the second shell of an atom?**

The maximum number of electrons in the second shell is **8** electrons.

# Percentage Composition from Molecular Formula

The **percentage composition** of a compound refers to the percentage by mass of each element in the compound. This can be calculated from the molecular formula, which shows the exact number of atoms of each element in the molecule.

To calculate the percentage composition, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the molecular formula** of the compound.
2. **Calculate the molar mass** (molecular weight) of the compound by adding the atomic masses of all the atoms present in the molecular formula.
3. **Calculate the mass contribution** of each element in the compound.
4. **Divide the mass of each element** by the total molar mass of the compound and multiply by 100 to find the percentage.

## Example Calculation

Consider the molecular formula of water: **H₂O**.

1. The molecular formula shows there are 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom.
2. The atomic mass of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 amu, and the atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 amu.
3. The molar mass of water is calculated as:
   $$
   (2 \times 1) + (1 \times 16) = 18 \text{ amu}
   $$
4. Now, calculate the mass contribution of each element:
   - Mass of hydrogen: $(2 \times 1) = 2$ amu
   - Mass of oxygen: $(1 \times 16) = 16$ amu
5. To find the percentage composition:
   - Percentage of hydrogen:
     $$
     \frac{2}{18} \times 100 = 11.11\%
     $$
   - Percentage of oxygen:
     $$
     \frac{16}{18} \times 100 = 88.89\%
     $$

So, the percentage composition of water is:

- **Hydrogen: 11.11%**
- **Oxygen: 88.89%**

## Summary

- **Percentage composition** indicates the proportion of each element in a compound by mass.
- It can be calculated using the molecular formula of the compound.
- The formula to calculate the percentage composition is:
  $$
  \text{Percentage of element} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of element in formula}}{\text{Molar mass of compound}} \right) \times 100
  $$

## FAQs

### 1. What is percentage composition?

Percentage composition refers to the percentage by mass of each element in a compound.

### 2. How do you calculate percentage composition from a molecular formula?

To calculate the percentage composition from a molecular formula, you determine the molar mass of the compound and then calculate the mass contribution of each element. The mass of each element is divided by the molar mass of the compound, and the result is multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.

### 3. Why is it important to calculate percentage composition?

Calculating the percentage composition helps in understanding the distribution of elements in a compound, which is useful in chemical analysis and reactions.

### 4. Can percentage composition be calculated for any compound?

Yes, as long as the molecular formula is known, percentage composition can be calculated for any compound.

### 5. Is the percentage composition the same for all compounds with the same molecular formula?

Yes, the percentage composition is the same for all molecules of a given compound because it depends only on the molecular formula, which is fixed.

### 6. What is the formula used for percentage composition calculation?

The formula is:

$$
\text{Percentage of element} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of element in formula}}{\text{Molar mass of compound}} \right) \times 100
$$

### 7. How is molar mass calculated for percentage composition?

Molar mass is calculated by summing the atomic masses of all atoms in the molecular formula.

### 8. Does percentage composition depend on the amount of substance?

No, percentage composition is a fixed property for a compound and does not depend on the sample size.

### 9. What information is needed to calculate percentage composition?

To calculate percentage composition, you need the molecular formula and atomic masses of each element in the compound.

### 10. Is it possible to have a negative percentage composition?

No, percentage composition values are always positive, as they represent the positive mass contributions of elements.

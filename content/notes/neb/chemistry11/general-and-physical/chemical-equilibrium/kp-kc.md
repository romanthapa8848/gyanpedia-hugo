# Relationship Between $K_p$ and $K_c$

---

## Introduction

In chemical equilibrium, the equilibrium constant can be expressed in different forms, depending on whether the reaction involves gases or solutions. For gaseous reactions, two types of equilibrium constants are used: $K_p$, which is based on partial pressures, and $K_c$, which is based on concentrations. Understanding the relationship between $K_p$ and $K_c$ is crucial for interpreting and calculating equilibrium constants for gas-phase reactions.

## General Form of $K_p$ and $K_c$

For a general gas-phase reaction:

$$
aA(g) + bB(g) \rightleftharpoons cC(g) + dD(g)
$$

The equilibrium constant can be expressed in terms of:

- **$K_p$** (based on partial pressures):

  $$
  K_p = \frac{(P_C)^c (P_D)^d}{(P_A)^a (P_B)^b}
  $$

- **$K_c$** (based on concentrations):
  $$
  K_c = \frac{[C]^c [D]^d}{[A]^a [B]^b}
  $$

Where:

- $P_A$, $P_B$, $P_C$, and $P_D$ are the partial pressures of the gases involved.
- $[A]$, $[B]$, $[C]$, and $[D]$ are the molar concentrations of the gases at equilibrium.
- $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are the stoichiometric coefficients.

## Relationship Between $K_p$ and $K_c$

The relationship between $K_p$ and $K_c$ depends on the change in the number of moles of gases in the reaction. This is given by:

$$
K_p = K_c \left( RT \right)^{\Delta n}
$$

Where:

- $R$ is the gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)).
- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.
- $\Delta n$ is the change in the number of moles of gases between the products and reactants:
  $$
  \Delta n = (c + d) - (a + b)
  $$

### Key Points:

- If $\Delta n = 0$, then $K_p = K_c$.
- If $\Delta n > 0$, $K_p > K_c$ (increase in moles of gas results in a higher partial pressure).
- If $\Delta n < 0$, $K_p < K_c$ (decrease in moles of gas results in a lower partial pressure).

## Examples of $K_p$ and $K_c$

1. **Reaction with no change in moles ($\Delta n = 0$):**

   For the reaction:

   $$
   N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3(g)
   $$

   Here, the number of moles of reactants (4) is equal to the number of moles of products (2), so $\Delta n = 0$. Thus, $K_p = K_c$.

2. **Reaction with $\Delta n > 0$:**

   For the reaction:

   $$
   N_2(g) + 2O_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NO(g)
   $$

   Here, the number of moles of reactants (3) is less than the number of moles of products (2), so $\Delta n = 1$. This implies that $K_p > K_c$.

3. **Reaction with $\Delta n < 0$:**

   For the reaction:

   $$
   2NO(g) \rightleftharpoons N_2(g) + O_2(g)
   $$

   Here, the number of moles of reactants (2) is greater than the number of moles of products (2), so $\Delta n = -1$. This implies that $K_p < K_c$.

## Comparison Table: $K_p$ vs $K_c$

| Condition      | $K_p$       | $K_c$       |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| $\Delta n = 0$ | $K_p = K_c$ | $K_p = K_c$ |
| $\Delta n > 0$ | $K_p > K_c$ | $K_p > K_c$ |
| $\Delta n < 0$ | $K_p < K_c$ | $K_p < K_c$ |

## Summary

The relationship between $K_p$ and $K_c$ is governed by the change in the number of moles of gases in a reaction. Understanding this relationship is important for interpreting equilibrium constants in gas-phase reactions, particularly in cases where partial pressures and concentrations are involved. The equation $K_p = K_c (RT)^{\Delta n}$ is a key tool in converting between these two forms of equilibrium constants.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the difference between $K_p$ and $K_c$?

$K_p$ is the equilibrium constant based on partial pressures of gases, while $K_c$ is the equilibrium constant based on the concentrations of gases.

### 2. What does it mean if $\Delta n = 0$?

If $\Delta n = 0$, then $K_p = K_c$. This means the number of moles of gaseous reactants and products are equal.

### 3. How does $\Delta n$ affect the relationship between $K_p$ and $K_c$?

- If $\Delta n > 0$, $K_p > K_c$.
- If $\Delta n < 0$, $K_p < K_c$.
- If $\Delta n = 0$, $K_p = K_c$.

### 4. Can $K_p$ and $K_c$ be equal?

Yes, when $\Delta n = 0$, meaning the number of moles of gases is the same on both sides of the equation, $K_p$ and $K_c$ are equal.

### 5. What happens if $\Delta n$ is positive?

If $\Delta n > 0$, it means the number of moles of products is greater than the number of moles of reactants, resulting in $K_p > K_c$.

### 6. What is the significance of the equation $K_p = K_c (RT)^{\Delta n}$?

This equation shows how $K_p$ and $K_c$ are related and how they change depending on the temperature and the change in the number of moles of gas.

### 7. What is the effect of temperature on $K_p$ and $K_c$?

Temperature affects both $K_p$ and $K_c$, but they remain related by the equation $K_p = K_c (RT)^{\Delta n}$. If temperature increases, it can affect $\Delta n$ and the value of $K_p$ and $K_c$.

### 8. Can $K_p$ and $K_c$ have different units?

Yes, the units of $K_p$ and $K_c$ depend on the number of moles of gases involved in the reaction and the temperature.

### 9. What is $R$ in the equation $K_p = K_c (RT)^{\Delta n}$?

$R$ is the gas constant, which is typically 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when using pressures in atmospheres and volumes in liters.

### 10. Does the equation $K_p = K_c (RT)^{\Delta n}$ apply to all reactions?

This equation applies to reactions involving gases where the equilibrium constants are expressed in terms of partial pressures ($K_p$) and concentrations ($K_c$).

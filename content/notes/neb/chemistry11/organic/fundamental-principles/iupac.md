# IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds (up to 6-Carbon Chains)

The **International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)** has developed systematic naming rules for organic compounds. This guide covers the basics of naming compounds with carbon chains containing up to six carbons.

---

## Principles of IUPAC Nomenclature

### 1. Identify the Longest Continuous Carbon Chain
- Find the longest carbon chain, which serves as the "parent chain." The number of carbons in this chain determines the base name:
  - **1 carbon:** Methane
  - **2 carbons:** Ethane
  - **3 carbons:** Propane
  - **4 carbons:** Butane
  - **5 carbons:** Pentane
  - **6 carbons:** Hexane

### 2. Identify and Name Substituents
- Any groups attached to the parent chain (e.g., alkyl or halogen groups) are named as substituents. Their position on the chain is indicated by numbering the carbon atoms.

### 3. Number the Chain
- Number the carbon atoms in the longest chain to give the lowest possible numbers to substituents.

### 4. Combine the Names
- Construct the name by listing substituents alphabetically, along with their position numbers, followed by the base name of the parent chain.

## Summary

This guide presents the IUPAC rules for naming organic compounds with up to six carbons. It covers how to identify the longest chain, assign numbers, and construct systematic names by combining substituent names with the parent chain.

## FAQs

### 1. What is IUPAC nomenclature?
IUPAC nomenclature is a systematic method for naming chemical compounds.

### 2. Why is the longest chain important in naming?
The longest chain determines the base name of the compound.

### 3. How do substituents affect the compound name?
Substituents modify the base name, indicating attached groups and their positions.

### 4. What prefix is used for a 4-carbon chain?
The prefix "but-" is used.

### 5. How are multiple substituents ordered in the name?
They are listed alphabetically, regardless of their position numbers.

### 6. What if two chains of equal length are found?
Choose the chain with the most substituents.

### 7. How is a compound with no substituents named?
It takes the name of the longest chain (e.g., propane for a 3-carbon chain).

### 8. What is the prefix for a 5-carbon chain?
The prefix "pent-" is used.

### 9. What are common substituents in organic compounds?
Common substituents include methyl, ethyl, and halogens.

### 10. How are double or triple bonds indicated?
They are indicated with suffixes like "-ene" for double bonds and "-yne" for triple bonds.

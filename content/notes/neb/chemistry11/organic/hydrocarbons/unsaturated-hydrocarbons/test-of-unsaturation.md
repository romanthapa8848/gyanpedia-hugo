# Test of Unsaturation (Ethene and Ethyne)

Alkenes and alkynes, such as **ethene (C₂H₄)** and **ethyne (C₂H₂)**, are **unsaturated hydrocarbons**. This unsaturation can be detected using two common tests: the **Bromine Water Test** and **Baeyer's Test**.

---

## 1. Bromine Water Test

The bromine water test detects the presence of **double or triple bonds** by adding bromine in water, which is brown in color. In the presence of unsaturated hydrocarbons, bromine reacts with the double or triple bonds, causing the brown color to disappear.

### Reaction with Ethene (C₂H₄)

Ethene reacts with bromine to form **1,2-dibromoethane**:
$$ \text{C}_2\text{H}_4 + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_4\text{Br}_2 $$

### Reaction with Ethyne (C₂H₂)

Ethyne also decolorizes bromine water, forming **tetrabromoethane**:
$$ \text{C}_2\text{H}_2 + 2\text{Br}_2 \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_2\text{Br}_4 $$

**Observation**: In both cases, the brown color of bromine disappears, confirming the presence of unsaturation.

## 2. Baeyer's Test (Potassium Permanganate Test)

Baeyer's test, also known as the **Potassium Permanganate Test**, detects unsaturation by adding a dilute solution of potassium permanganate (KMnO₄). In the presence of unsaturated compounds, KMnO₄ gets reduced and changes color from purple to colorless or brown, depending on the concentration of the alkyne or alkene.

### Reaction with Ethene (C₂H₄)

Ethene reacts with potassium permanganate to form **ethylene glycol** and results in a color change:
$$ \text{C}_2\text{H}_4 + \text{KMnO}_4 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_4(\text{OH})_2 + \text{MnO}_2 $$

### Reaction with Ethyne (C₂H₂)

Ethyne undergoes oxidation, forming an acidic product and causing the purple color of KMnO₄ to disappear:
$$ \text{C}_2\text{H}_2 + 2\text{KMnO}_4 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{CH}_2(\text{COOH})_2 + 2\text{MnO}_2 $$

**Observation**: The purple color of potassium permanganate fades or turns brown due to the formation of manganese dioxide (MnO₂), confirming unsaturation.

## Summary

Both the bromine water test and Baeyer's test are effective for identifying unsaturation in hydrocarbons. Bromine water loses its color when reacting with alkenes or alkynes, while KMnO₄ turns colorless or brown upon reaction with these unsaturated compounds.

## FAQs

### 1. What is a test of unsaturation?
Tests of unsaturation detect **double or triple bonds** in organic compounds.

### 2. Why does bromine water lose color with alkenes?
Bromine reacts with the **double bonds** in alkenes, resulting in a **colorless product**.

### 3. What is Baeyer's test used for?
Baeyer's test uses potassium permanganate to identify **unsaturated compounds**.

### 4. What color change indicates a positive Baeyer's test?
The **purple color** of KMnO₄ fades or turns **brown**, indicating unsaturation.

### 5. Which compounds decolorize bromine water?
**Alkenes** and **alkynes** decolorize bromine water.

### 6. What is the result of ethene in Baeyer's test?
Ethene reacts to produce **ethylene glycol** and causes the **color change** in KMnO₄.

### 7. Does benzene react with bromine water?
**No**, benzene does not react under normal conditions, as it is less reactive.

### 8. What is the product of ethyne and KMnO₄?
Ethyne reacts to form **oxalic acid** or other oxidized products.

### 9. How does bromine react with ethyne?
Ethyne reacts with **two molecules of bromine** to form tetrabromoethane.

### 10. Is the bromine water test specific to alkenes?
It is **not specific**; it detects unsaturation in both alkenes and alkynes.

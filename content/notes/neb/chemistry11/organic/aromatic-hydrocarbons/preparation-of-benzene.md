# Preparation of Benzene from Decarboxylation of Sodium Benzoate, Phenol, and Ethyne

Benzene ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_6$) is an important aromatic compound with various methods of preparation. In this section, we will discuss three common methods to prepare benzene: 

1. **Decarboxylation of Sodium Benzoate** (Kolbe's Electrolysis)
2. **Reduction of Phenol**
3. **From Ethyne (Acetylene)**

## 1. Decarboxylation of Sodium Benzoate (Kolbe's Electrolysis)

The decarboxylation of sodium benzoate is one of the classical methods for preparing benzene. This process is carried out by Kolbe's electrolysis method.

### Reaction:

When sodium benzoate ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{COONa}$) is subjected to electrolysis in a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), it undergoes decarboxylation, where the carboxyl group ($\text{-COOH}$) is removed as carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), producing benzene.

The reaction is as follows:

$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{COONa} \xrightarrow{\text{electrolysis}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{CO}_2
$$

In this reaction, the sodium benzoate is electrolyzed, resulting in the formation of benzene and the release of carbon dioxide. This reaction takes place in an electrolytic cell with a carbon anode and cathode.

## 2. Reduction of Phenol

Phenol ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{OH}$) can be reduced to benzene by using reducing agents like zinc dust or by other reducing agents under suitable conditions. 

### Reaction:

When phenol is heated with zinc dust, it undergoes reduction to form benzene:

$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{OH} \xrightarrow{\text{Zn dust}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

In this reaction, phenol loses the hydroxyl group ($\text{-OH}$), and the hydrogen atom replaces the oxygen atom to form benzene.

## 3. Preparation of Benzene from Ethyne (Acetylene)

Benzene can also be prepared by the reaction of ethyne (acetylene) with sodium at high temperature, known as the **Wurtz-Fittig reaction**. In this reaction, two molecules of ethyne react in the presence of sodium metal to form benzene.

### Reaction:

$$
2\text{C}_2\text{H}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Na}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_6
$$

In this reaction, ethyne (acetylene) undergoes a coupling reaction, where two molecules of ethyne combine in the presence of sodium metal to form benzene.

## Summary

Benzene can be prepared through various methods:

1. **Decarboxylation of Sodium Benzoate** (Kolbe’s electrolysis) results in the removal of a carboxyl group, forming benzene.
2. **Reduction of Phenol** using zinc dust leads to the removal of the hydroxyl group, yielding benzene.
3. **Reaction of Ethyne (Acetylene)** with sodium at high temperatures leads to the formation of benzene through a coupling reaction.

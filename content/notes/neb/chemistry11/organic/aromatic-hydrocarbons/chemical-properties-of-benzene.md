# Chemical Properties of Benzene

Benzene ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_6$) exhibits distinct chemical properties due to its aromatic nature. These include addition reactions, electrophilic substitution reactions, and combustion reactions. Benzene's unique stability comes from its conjugated $\pi$-electron system, which participates in these reactions under specific conditions.

---

## Addition Reactions

Benzene, being an aromatic compound, is relatively resistant to addition reactions due to its stable $\pi$-electron system. However, it can undergo some addition reactions under specific conditions:

### 1. Addition of Hydrogen

When benzene is hydrogenated in the presence of a catalyst (like nickel or platinum) at high temperatures and pressures, it undergoes an **addition of hydrogen** to form cyclohexane ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}$):

$$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + 3\text{H}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Ni}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12} $$

---

### 2. Addition of Halogens

Benzene can react with halogens ($\text{X}_2$) like chlorine ($\text{Cl}_2$) or bromine ($\text{Br}_2$) in the presence of a catalyst (like FeCl₃) to undergo **addition reactions**:

$$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{X}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{FeCl}_3} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{X} + \text{HX} $$

In this reaction, one hydrogen atom from the benzene molecule is replaced by the halogen atom, forming an aryl halide.

---

## Electrophilic Substitution Reactions

Benzene undergoes **electrophilic substitution reactions**, where an electrophile attacks the benzene ring, replacing one of its hydrogen atoms. The position of substitution is influenced by the substituents already present on the benzene ring. The orientation of benzene derivatives can be ortho (o), meta (m), or para (p) based on the substituent's electron-donating or electron-withdrawing nature.

### 1. Nitration of Benzene

Benzene reacts with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid ($\text{HNO}_3$) and sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$) to undergo **nitration**, resulting in nitrobenzene ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NO}_2$):

$$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{HNO}_3 \xrightarrow{\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} $$

This is a classic electrophilic substitution reaction where the nitronium ion ($\text{NO}_2^+$) is the electrophile.

---

### 2. Sulphonation of Benzene

Benzene reacts with fuming sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$) to undergo **sulphonation**, producing benzenesulfonic acid ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{SO}_3\text{H}$):

$$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \xrightarrow{\text{fuming}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{SO}_3\text{H} $$

This reaction involves the formation of the electrophilic sulfonium ion ($\text{SO}_3^+$).

---

### 3. Halogenation of Benzene

Benzene reacts with halogens (such as chlorine or bromine) in the presence of a catalyst like iron chloride (FeCl₃) or iron bromide (FeBr₃) to undergo **halogenation**:

$$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{X}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{FeCl}_3} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{X} + \text{HX} $$

Where $\text{X}$ is a halogen atom (Cl or Br).

---

### 4. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation

In the **Friedel-Crafts alkylation** reaction, benzene reacts with an alkyl halide (such as $\text{RCl}$) in the presence of an aluminum chloride ($\text{AlCl}_3$) catalyst, forming an alkylated benzene ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{R}$):

$$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{RCl} \xrightarrow{\text{AlCl}_3} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{R} $$

---

### 5. Friedel-Crafts Acylation

In the **Friedel-Crafts acylation**, benzene reacts with an acyl chloride ($\text{RCOCl}$) in the presence of an $\text{AlCl}_3$ catalyst, producing an aryl ketone:

$$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{RCOCl} \xrightarrow{\text{AlCl}_3} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{COR} $$

---

## Combustion of Benzene

When benzene undergoes combustion, it reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water:

$$ \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + 15 \, \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 6 \, \text{CO}_2 + 3 \, \text{H}_2\text{O} $$

This is a **free combustion reaction** that releases a large amount of heat.

---

## Uses of Benzene

Benzene is widely used in the chemical industry and has several important applications:

1. **Production of Synthetic Polymers**: Benzene is used as a starting material for producing styrene, which is then polymerized to form polystyrene, used in packaging and insulation.

2. **Manufacture of Drugs and Plastics**: Benzene derivatives are used to manufacture various drugs, such as aspirin, and plastics like nylon and synthetic rubber.

3. **Solvent**: Due to its non-polar nature, benzene is used as a solvent in laboratories and industries.

4. **Dyes and Detergents**: Benzene is also used in the synthesis of dyes and detergents.

---

## Summary

Benzene undergoes addition and electrophilic substitution reactions. It reacts with hydrogen, halogens, and acids in various conditions. Electrophilic substitution reactions like nitration, sulphonation, halogenation, and Friedel-Crafts reactions (both alkylation and acylation) are key to benzene's reactivity. Benzene also undergoes combustion to form carbon dioxide and water. Its uses include the production of synthetic polymers, drugs, dyes, and as a solvent.

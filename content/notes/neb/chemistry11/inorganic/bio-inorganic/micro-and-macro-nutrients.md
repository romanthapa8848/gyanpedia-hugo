# Micro and Macro Nutrients

Nutrients are substances required by the body for growth, energy, and proper functioning. They are divided into two categories: **macro nutrients** and **micro nutrients**, based on the quantity required by the body.

## Macro Nutrients
Macro nutrients are needed in large quantities and are essential for providing energy and building body tissues. They are the primary nutrients that support overall health and well-being.

### Types of Macro Nutrients
1. **Carbohydrates**: 
   - **Function**: Provide the body with energy. They are broken down into glucose, which is the main energy source for the brain and muscles.
   - **Sources**: Bread, rice, pasta, potatoes, fruits, vegetables, and legumes.

2. **Proteins**: 
   - **Function**: Build and repair tissues, produce enzymes and hormones, and support immune function.
   - **Sources**: Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, beans, lentils, and nuts.

3. **Fats**:
   - **Function**: Provide energy, store vitamins, protect organs, and regulate body temperature.
   - **Sources**: Oils, butter, nuts, seeds, avocados, and fatty fish (like salmon).

4. **Water**:
   - **Function**: Regulate body temperature, maintain cell function, and transport nutrients throughout the body.
   - **Sources**: Water, fruits, vegetables, soups, and other beverages.

## Micro Nutrients
Micro nutrients are required by the body in smaller amounts, but they are just as important as macro nutrients for maintaining health and supporting vital functions.

### Types of Micro Nutrients
1. **Vitamins**:
   - **Function**: Regulate metabolism, support immune function, and help the body use energy from foods.
   - **Types of Vitamins**:
     - **Fat-soluble**: Vitamin A, D, E, K.
     - **Water-soluble**: Vitamin C, B vitamins (e.g., B12, folate, niacin).
   - **Sources**: Fruits, vegetables, dairy products, whole grains, and meat.

2. **Minerals**:
   - **Function**: Build bones and teeth, aid in nerve function, muscle function, and the production of hormones.
   - **Types of Minerals**:
     - **Major Minerals**: Calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, sodium, chloride, sulfur.
     - **Trace Minerals**: Iron, zinc, copper, iodine, selenium, manganese, fluoride, chromium.
   - **Sources**: Salt, dairy products, leafy greens, nuts, seeds, meat, fish, and whole grains.

## Importance of Nutrients in Human Health
- **Macro nutrients** provide energy and form the structural components of the body.
- **Micro nutrients** help regulate body processes and prevent deficiencies that can lead to chronic diseases.

|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Macro Nutrients** | Large amounts          | Provide energy, build body tissues, regulate body functions.  | Bread, rice, pasta, meat, dairy, vegetables      | Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats, Water     |
| **Micro Nutrients** | Small amounts          | Regulate metabolism, support immune function, prevent deficiencies. | Fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, nuts, seeds    | Vitamins (A, C, D), Minerals (Calcium, Iron) |

## Summary
Both micro and macro nutrients are essential for the proper functioning of the body. While macro nutrients provide energy and help in building the body, micro nutrients are important for regulating metabolism and supporting immune functions. A balanced diet that includes an adequate amount of both is crucial for overall health.

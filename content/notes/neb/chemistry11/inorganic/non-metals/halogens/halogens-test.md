# Test for Cl<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>

Halogens such as chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>), bromine (Br<sub>2</sub>), and iodine (I<sub>2</sub>) can be identified through specific chemical tests based on their unique properties. The tests are used to detect the presence of these halogens in samples and to differentiate between them.

### 1. **Test for Chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>)**

- **Test method:** Chlorine gas can be tested by its reaction with potassium iodide (KI) solution.
  
- **Chemical Reaction:**
  $$ Cl_2 + 2KI \rightarrow 2KCl + I_2 $$
  The reaction produces iodine (I₂) which is seen as a brown color in the solution.

- **Observation:** A brown color appears in the solution due to the formation of iodine.

- **Alternative Test:** Chlorine bleaches litmus paper. It turns blue litmus paper red due to its acidic nature and decolorizes the paper.

### 2. **Test for Bromine (Br<sub>2</sub>)**

- **Test method:** Bromine gas can be tested by its reaction with potassium iodide (KI) solution, similar to chlorine.
  
- **Chemical Reaction:**
  $$ Br_2 + 2KI \rightarrow 2KBr + I_2 $$
  Bromine displaces iodine from the solution, forming a brown color due to iodine.

- **Observation:** A brown color forms in the solution indicating the presence of bromine. The color may be less intense than that of chlorine.

- **Alternative Test:** Bromine gas is also reddish-brown and can be detected by the reddish-brown fumes that it emits when exposed to air.

### 3. **Test for Iodine (I<sub>2</sub>)**

- **Test method:** Iodine can be tested by adding starch solution to a sample. When iodine comes in contact with starch, a blue-black color forms.
  
- **Chemical Reaction:**
  $$ I_2 + starch \rightarrow Blue-black complex $$

- **Observation:** A blue-black color appears due to the formation of a starch-iodine complex.

- **Alternative Test:** Iodine can be sublimed to form violet vapors when heated, which can be observed as purple-colored fumes.

## Summary

The tests for chlorine, bromine, and iodine involve identifying their distinct reactions with substances like potassium iodide and starch. Chlorine gives a brown color in KI solution, bromine also produces a brown color but in a less intense form, while iodine produces a blue-black color when mixed with starch. Each halogen has unique properties that help in its identification.

## FAQs

### 1. How can chlorine be detected?
Chlorine can be detected by its reaction with potassium iodide, which forms iodine and turns the solution brown.

### 2. What is the color change when bromine reacts with potassium iodide?
Bromine displaces iodine from KI solution, causing a brown color to appear.

### 3. How can iodine be tested?
Iodine can be tested by adding starch solution to the sample, which forms a blue-black color.

### 4. Why does chlorine bleach litmus paper?
Chlorine is an oxidizing agent and acidic, so it turns blue litmus paper red and decolorizes it.

### 5. What color does iodine produce when heated?
When heated, iodine sublimes and produces violet vapors.

### 6. How can bromine be distinguished from chlorine?
Bromine produces a less intense brown color than chlorine when reacting with potassium iodide.

### 7. What is the reaction between chlorine and potassium iodide?
Chlorine displaces iodine from KI, forming potassium chloride and iodine gas.

### 8. Why does iodine give a blue-black color with starch?
Iodine reacts with starch to form a blue-black complex due to the molecular interaction.

### 9. How can the presence of iodine be visually confirmed?
The presence of iodine can be confirmed by a blue-black color with starch or violet vapor upon sublimation.

### 10. What is the physical state of bromine at room temperature?
Bromine is a liquid at room temperature and produces reddish-brown fumes.

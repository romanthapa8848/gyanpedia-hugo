# Chemical Properties of Nitric Acid (HNO₃) as an Acid and Oxidizing Agent

Nitric acid ($\text{HNO}_3$) is a strong acid and a powerful oxidizing agent. It has various chemical properties, including its ability to react with metals, non-metals, and other substances in both acidic and oxidative capacities. Below are the reactions of nitric acid with several substances:

---

## 1. **Action with Zinc (Zn)**

When nitric acid reacts with zinc, zinc nitrate ($\text{Zn(NO}_3)_2$) is formed, along with the liberation of nitrogen dioxide ($\text{NO}_2$) gas, which is a brown toxic gas.

### Reaction:

$$\text{Zn} + 2\text{HNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{Zn(NO}_3)_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{NO}_2(g)$$

---

## 2. **Action with Magnesium (Mg)**

Magnesium reacts with nitric acid to form magnesium nitrate ($\text{Mg(NO}_3)_2$) and hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$).

### Reaction:

$$\text{Mg} + 2\text{HNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{Mg(NO}_3)_2 + \text{H}_2(g)$$

---

## 3. **Action with Iron (Fe)**

When iron reacts with nitric acid, iron nitrate ($\text{Fe(NO}_3)_2$) or iron(III) nitrate ($\text{Fe(NO}_3)_3$) is formed, depending on the concentration of nitric acid. Nitrogen oxides such as $\text{NO}_2$ are also produced.

### Reaction (with concentrated nitric acid):

$$\text{Fe} + 6\text{HNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{Fe(NO}_3)_3 + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{NO}_2(g)$$

---

## 4. **Action with Copper (Cu)**

Copper reacts with nitric acid to form copper(II) nitrate ($\text{Cu(NO}_3)_2$), nitrogen dioxide ($\text{NO}_2$), and water.

### Reaction (with concentrated nitric acid):

$$\text{Cu} + 4\text{HNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{Cu(NO}_3)_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{NO}_2(g)$$

---

## 5. **Action with Sulphur (S)**

Sulphur reacts with nitric acid to form sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$) and sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$), with nitric acid acting as an oxidizing agent.

### Reaction:

$$\text{S} + 2\text{HNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 + 2\text{NO}_2(g) + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

---

## 6. **Action with Carbon (C)**

Carbon reacts with nitric acid to produce carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and nitrogen dioxide ($\text{NO}_2$).

### Reaction:

$$\text{C} + 2\text{HNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{NO}_2(g) + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

---

## 7. **Action with Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂)**

Nitric acid reacts with sulfur dioxide to form sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$) and nitrogen dioxide ($\text{NO}_2$).

### Reaction:

$$\text{SO}_2 + 2\text{HNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 + 2\text{NO}_2(g)$$

---

## 8. **Action with Hydrogen Sulfide (H₂S)**

Hydrogen sulfide reacts with nitric acid to produce sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides.

### Reaction:

$$\text{H}_2\text{S} + 4\text{HNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{S} + 4\text{NO}_2(g) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

---

## Summary

- **As an Acid**: Nitric acid is a strong acid and reacts with metals like zinc, magnesium, and iron to produce corresponding nitrates and hydrogen or nitrogen oxides.
- **As an Oxidizing Agent**: Nitric acid acts as a powerful oxidizing agent, reacting with non-metals such as carbon, sulfur, and hydrogen sulfide to produce nitrogen oxides and other products.

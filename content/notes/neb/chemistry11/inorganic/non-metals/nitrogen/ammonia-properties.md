# Chemical Properties of Ammonia (NH₃)

Ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$) is a colorless gas with a pungent odor. It is highly soluble in water and exhibits a variety of chemical properties when reacting with different substances. Below are the reactions of ammonia with some common chemicals:

---

## 1. **Action with Copper(II) Sulfate Solution (CuSO₄)**

When ammonia gas is passed through copper(II) sulfate ($\text{CuSO}_4$) solution, a deep blue solution of ammoniacal copper(II) complex is formed.

### Reaction:

$$\text{CuSO}_4 + 4\text{NH}_3 \rightarrow [\text{Cu(NH}_3)_4]SO_4$$

The deep blue color is due to the formation of the $\text{Cu(NH}_3)_4^{2+}$ complex ion.

---

## 2. **Action with Water**

Ammonia dissolves readily in water to form ammonium hydroxide ($\text{NH}_4\text{OH}$), which is a weak base.

### Reaction:

$$\text{NH}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{NH}_4\text{OH}$$

Ammonium hydroxide dissociates slightly into ammonium ($\text{NH}_4^+$) and hydroxide ($\text{OH}^-$) ions.

---

## 3. **Action with Ferric Chloride (FeCl₃) Solution**

Ammonia reacts with ferric chloride ($\text{FeCl}_3$) solution to form a reddish-brown precipitate of ferric hydroxide ($\text{Fe(OH)}_3$), which is insoluble in water.

### Reaction:

$$\text{FeCl}_3 + 3\text{NH}_3 + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{NH}_4\text{Cl}$$

The ferric hydroxide precipitate appears reddish-brown.

---

## 4. **Action with Concentrated Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)**

Ammonia gas reacts with concentrated hydrochloric acid to form ammonium chloride ($\text{NH}_4\text{Cl}$), which appears as a white smoke.

### Reaction:

$$\text{NH}_3 + \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{NH}_4\text{Cl}$$

This reaction is exothermic and produces dense white fumes of ammonium chloride.

---

## 5. **Action with Mercurous Nitrate Paper**

When ammonia gas is passed through mercurous nitrate ($\text{Hg}_2\text{NO}_3$) paper, a black stain is produced due to the formation of mercurous ammonium nitrate.

### Reaction:

$$\text{Hg}_2\text{NO}_3 + 2\text{NH}_3 \rightarrow \text{Hg}_2(\text{NH}_3)_2\text{NO}_3$$

The formation of the black compound confirms the presence of ammonia.

---

## 6. **Action with Oxygen (O₂)**

Ammonia can react with oxygen, especially at high temperatures, to form nitrogen monoxide (NO) and water. This reaction is often used in industrial processes such as the Ostwald process for producing nitric acid.

### Reaction:

$$4\text{NH}_3 + 3\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{N}_2 + 6\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

This reaction is highly exothermic and requires a catalyst at high temperatures for efficiency.

## Individual (Non-institutional) Buyers

### Concept:

Individual buyers, also known as non-institutional buyers, are consumers who purchase goods and services for personal use. These buyers typically make purchase decisions based on their personal preferences, needs, and desires. They are the most common type of buyer in the market and their buying behavior is often influenced by psychological, social, and emotional factors.

### Characteristics:

1. **Personal Use**: The primary reason for purchase is personal consumption or need.
2. **Decision-making Process**: Decisions are often influenced by individual preferences, advertising, social influences, and family.
3. **Small-scale Purchases**: The volume of purchases is generally small compared to institutional buyers.
4. **Emotional Buying**: The purchase decisions are often driven by emotions, lifestyle choices, and personal satisfaction.
5. **Varied Preferences**: These buyers have varied needs based on their income, age, family status, and interests.

### Examples:

- A person buying a new smartphone or a pair of shoes for personal use.
- A student purchasing a laptop for academic purposes.

## Institutional (Organizational) Buyers

### Concept:

Institutional buyers, or organizational buyers, are entities such as businesses, government agencies, and non-profit organizations that purchase goods and services for further processing, resale, or use in their operations. Unlike individual buyers, institutional buyers are often concerned with the functionality, cost-efficiency, and long-term value of products or services rather than personal preferences.

### Characteristics:

1. **Business Use**: The primary purpose is to fulfill operational needs, production processes, or for resale.
2. **Bulk Purchases**: Institutional buyers often make large-scale purchases compared to individual buyers.
3. **Rational Decision-making**: These buyers make decisions based on rational factors such as cost, quality, durability, and supplier reliability.
4. **Formal Decision Process**: The purchasing process involves multiple stages, such as need recognition, supplier evaluation, and approval from different levels of the organization.
5. **Long-term Relationships**: These buyers often build long-term relationships with suppliers and may enter into contracts for ongoing business.

### Examples:

- A manufacturing company purchasing raw materials for production.
- A government agency buying office equipment for its operations.

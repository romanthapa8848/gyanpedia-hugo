# Concepts of Market: Place Concept, Area Concept, Demand Concept

In marketing, the term "market" can be defined and interpreted in different ways. Understanding the various concepts of the market is essential for businesses to identify target segments, define their market, and develop appropriate strategies. The following are three major concepts of the market: **Place Concept**, **Area Concept**, and **Demand Concept**.

---

## 1. Place Concept

**Meaning**:
The **Place Concept** of the market refers to the physical location or area where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods and services. This could be a physical store, marketplace, or even an online platform where the exchange takes place. The focus is on the geographical aspect of the market and the physical space where transactions occur.

**Key Points**:

- The market is defined by the place or location of the transaction.
- It highlights the importance of convenience and accessibility in reaching customers.
- Often associated with retail or wholesale markets where goods are sold directly to customers.

**Example**:

- A shopping mall is an example of a **Place Concept** of the market, where multiple vendors and consumers meet to buy and sell goods.

## 2. Area Concept

**Meaning**:
The **Area Concept** of the market extends the idea of the **Place Concept** to a larger geographical region. It refers to the broader area or region within which buyers and sellers engage in the exchange of goods and services. This could be a city, region, or even a country. The **Area Concept** takes into account the target market in terms of the physical space it covers.

**Key Points**:

- The market can be geographically defined to include a specific area.
- It involves a larger geographical scope than the Place Concept, possibly covering cities, regions, or nations.
- Market size is determined by the area and the potential customers within it.

**Example**:

- A national retail chain like Walmart may define its market under the **Area Concept**, targeting customers across different states or regions.

## 3. Demand Concept

**Meaning**:
The **Demand Concept** of the market is based on the demand for goods and services. According to this concept, the market is defined by the volume of demand for a product or service, irrespective of its physical location. The focus is on the customers' willingness and ability to purchase goods or services.

**Key Points**:

- The market is determined by the demand for products and services.
- It highlights the importance of consumer needs and purchasing power.
- The demand-driven market is more about identifying potential customers and their preferences.

**Example**:

- The smartphone market is an example of the **Demand Concept**, where the market is driven by the demand for smartphones rather than the location or area where they are sold.

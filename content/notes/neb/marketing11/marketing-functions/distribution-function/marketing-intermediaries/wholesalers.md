Wholesalers play a vital role in the smooth flow of goods and services from production to consumption.

## Types of Wholesalers

### 1. Merchant Wholesalers

**Merchant wholesalers** are independent businesses that take ownership of the goods they buy and sell. They usually buy products in large quantities from manufacturers and sell them in smaller lots to retailers or other wholesalers. They assume the risks associated with the products they handle, including warehousing and distribution.

#### Features:

- **Ownership of Goods**: They purchase products and take title to the goods.
- **Bulk Buying and Selling**: They buy products in bulk and sell them in smaller quantities.
- **Risk-Bearing**: They take on the risks related to storage and market fluctuations.

#### Example:

- A wholesaler that buys electronics in bulk from manufacturers and sells them to local retail stores.

### 2. Agent Wholesalers

**Agent wholesalers** do not take ownership of the goods they sell. Instead, they act as intermediaries between the manufacturer and the buyer. They earn a commission or fee for facilitating sales, rather than making a profit on the sale of goods.

#### Features:

- **No Ownership**: They do not take ownership of the goods.
- **Commission-Based**: They earn a commission or fee for their services.
- **Specialized Role**: They often have specialized knowledge of the market or product.

#### Example:

### 3. Manufacturer-Wholesalers (Manufacturer's Sales Branches)

**Manufacturer-wholesalers**, also known as **manufacturer's sales branches**, are wholesaling arms of manufacturers. They sell the company’s own products directly to retailers, other wholesalers, or business customers, bypassing independent wholesalers. These are owned and operated by the manufacturer.

#### Features:

- **Manufacturer-Owned**: They are directly owned and operated by the manufacturer.
- **Direct Selling**: They sell the manufacturer's own products to retailers or other businesses.
- **Control Over Distribution**: Manufacturers can have greater control over pricing, branding, and distribution.

#### Example:

## Functions of Wholesalers

### 7. **Breaking Bulk**

Wholesalers buy goods in bulk from manufacturers and break them down into smaller quantities that are easier for retailers to handle and sell. This reduces the burden on retailers, who can buy products in amounts that meet their needs.

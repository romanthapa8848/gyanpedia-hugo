# Agents – Meaning, Types, and Functions

Agents are intermediaries who act on behalf of manufacturers or sellers and help facilitate the marketing and sale of products. They play a crucial role in connecting producers with buyers and handling various aspects of the marketing process. Agents do not take ownership of the goods they sell; instead, they work on a commission or fee basis for their services.

## Types of Agents

### 1. Manufacturer's Agent

A **manufacturer's agent** represents a manufacturer and sells products on their behalf in a specific geographical area. These agents typically have a long-term relationship with the manufacturer and work exclusively for them.

#### Features:

- **Exclusive Representation**: They represent a specific manufacturer in a designated area.
- **Commission-Based**: They earn a commission for the sales they generate.
- **Long-Term Relationship**: Typically, the relationship between the manufacturer and the agent is long-term.

#### Example:

### 2. Sole Agent

A **sole agent** is granted exclusive rights to sell a particular product within a specified region or market. Unlike other agents, sole agents may not represent any other competitor products in the same region.

#### Features:

- **Exclusive Rights**: They have the sole right to market and sell a product in a particular region.
- **Long-Term Agreement**: Sole agents often have long-term contracts with manufacturers.
- **Limited to a Specific Product**: They usually deal with only one product or a specific range of products.

#### Example:

- A sole agent for a luxury car brand in a specific city.

### 3. Commission Agent (Full-Service Agents)

A **commission agent**, also known as a **full-service agent**, is an intermediary who helps facilitate the sale of products but does not take ownership of the goods. They work on behalf of the seller and earn a commission for each sale they make. Full-service agents are involved in the entire sales process, from finding buyers to completing sales.

#### Features:

- **No Ownership of Goods**: They do not own the goods but sell them on behalf of the owner.
- **Full Range of Services**: They assist with negotiations, promotions, and handling of sales.
- **Commission-Based**: They earn a commission based on the sales they generate.

#### Example:

- An agent representing a manufacturer of furniture who takes care of all aspects of selling, from identifying customers to finalizing deals.

### 4. Limited-Service Agent

A **limited-service agent** offers fewer services compared to a full-service agent. They focus on a specific aspect of the sales process, such as introducing buyers to sellers, and typically provide minimal support after the initial contact is made.

#### Features:

- **Limited Scope of Services**: They only offer limited services like facilitating the introduction between the buyer and seller.
- **Commission-Based**: Like full-service agents, they work for a commission on sales.
- **Specialized Role**: They usually have specialized knowledge of a particular market or product.

#### Example:

- A limited-service agent who introduces potential buyers of machinery to the manufacturer but does not handle the negotiation or post-sale activities.

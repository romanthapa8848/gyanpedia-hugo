# Meaning, Methods of Distribution, and Types of Marketing Intermediaries

Distribution in marketing refers to the process of making a product or service available for use or consumption by the target customer. It involves various steps and methods, ensuring that products move efficiently from the manufacturer to the final consumer.

---

## Meaning of Distribution

Distribution is a vital function in the marketing process. It encompasses all the activities that are necessary to ensure that a product reaches the right customer in the right quantity and at the right time. This involves selecting distribution channels, managing logistics, and coordinating the flow of goods from production to consumption.

## Methods of Distribution

The distribution process can be carried out through different methods, depending on the type of product, target market, and business objectives. The primary methods of distribution include:

### 1. **Direct Distribution (Zero-Level Channel)**

Direct distribution occurs when a manufacturer sells directly to the consumer, without involving any intermediaries. This method is often used for products like handmade goods, services, or high-value products that require personal selling.

- **Example:** Selling via a company-owned retail store or online website.

### 2. **Indirect Distribution (One or More Level Channel)**

In indirect distribution, one or more intermediaries are involved between the manufacturer and the final consumer. These intermediaries include wholesalers, retailers, or agents who facilitate the product's movement to the consumer.

- **Example:** A manufacturer sells to a wholesaler, who then sells to retailers, who ultimately sell to consumers.

### 3. **Intensive Distribution**

Intensive distribution aims to place products in as many outlets as possible to maximize product availability. This method is commonly used for everyday consumer goods, such as soft drinks, snacks, and toiletries.

- **Example:** Products are distributed to grocery stores, convenience stores, supermarkets, and vending machines.

### 4. **Selective Distribution**

Selective distribution involves using a limited number of outlets or intermediaries to distribute products. This method is suitable for products that do not require widespread distribution but are still accessible in several locations. It is often used for branded or high-end products.

- **Example:** Electronic products like laptops or smartphones may be sold through selected electronics stores.

### 5. **Exclusive Distribution**

Exclusive distribution is a method in which a manufacturer grants exclusive rights to a specific retailer or distributor in a particular region. It is often used for high-end or luxury products to maintain brand exclusivity and image.

- **Example:** High-end fashion brands or luxury cars may only be available at specific authorized retailers or showrooms.

## Types of Marketing Intermediaries

Marketing intermediaries are organizations or individuals that assist in the distribution of products from the producer to the consumer. The main types of marketing intermediaries include:

### 1. **Wholesalers**

Wholesalers are businesses that buy large quantities of goods from manufacturers and sell them in smaller quantities to retailers or other intermediaries. They play a crucial role in bridging the gap between producers and retailers.

- **Example:** A wholesaler buys products in bulk from a manufacturer and sells them to local retail stores.

### 2. **Retailers**

Retailers are businesses or individuals that sell products directly to the final consumers. They operate physical stores or online platforms where customers can purchase products for personal use.

- **Example:** Supermarkets, clothing stores, or online retailers like Amazon or Flipkart.

### 3. **Distributors**

Distributors are intermediaries who have a more direct relationship with the manufacturer and often have exclusive rights to sell the manufacturer's products in a particular region. They are responsible for the logistics and supply chain functions as well as promoting the product to retailers.

- **Example:** A distributor may handle products for a specific region and sell them to retailers or wholesalers.

### 4. **Agents and Brokers**

Agents and brokers are intermediaries who facilitate the sale of products but do not take ownership of the goods. Agents typically work on behalf of the manufacturer to represent their interests, while brokers help connect buyers and sellers.

- **Example:** A real estate agent or an insurance broker acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller.

### 5. **Franchisees**

Franchisees are individuals or companies that purchase the rights to operate a business under an established brand name. They are provided with a proven business model and support from the franchisor in exchange for a fee or a percentage of sales.

- **Example:** Fast food chains like McDonald's and Subway operate through franchises, where individual owners run the business under the brand’s guidelines.

### 6. **Drop Shippers**

Drop shippers are intermediaries who facilitate sales between a supplier and the consumer without handling the products themselves. They arrange for the product to be shipped directly from the manufacturer or wholesaler to the consumer.

- **Example:** An online store selling products from suppliers who ship directly to the consumer, without the store ever handling the goods.

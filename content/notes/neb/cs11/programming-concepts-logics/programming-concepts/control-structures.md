# Control Structures: Sequence, Selection, and Iteration

Control structures are essential elements of programming, allowing developers to control the flow of program execution. These structures can be categorized into **Sequence**, **Selection**, and **Iteration**.

## Sequence

The sequence control structure is the simplest form of flow control. It ensures that instructions are executed one after another in the order they appear. There are no decisions or loops in this structure; the program simply follows a linear path.

### Example:

1. Initialize program
2. Perform calculations
3. Display the result

## Selection

The selection control structure is used to make decisions in a program. Based on certain conditions, different paths are chosen, allowing the program to respond to different situations.

### Example:

If the condition is true:

- Execute one block of code
  Else:
- Execute another block of code

### Common Forms:

- `if` statements
- `else if` statements
- `else` statements

## Iteration

The iteration control structure allows the program to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. This is essential for repetitive tasks, such as counting or looping through a list of items.

### Example:

Repeat a set of instructions until a condition is met, or iterate a specific number of times.

### Common Forms:

- `for` loop
- `while` loop

## Summary

Control structures enable developers to manage the flow of execution within their programs.

- **Sequence** ensures the code is executed line-by-line in order.
- **Selection** allows decisions based on conditions.
- **Iteration** helps automate repetitive tasks through loops.

Each structure plays a vital role in building efficient, logical, and well-structured programs.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the purpose of control structures in programming?

Control structures manage the flow of execution, making programs flexible and responsive to different situations.

### 2. What is the difference between Sequence and Selection control structures?

- **Sequence** executes statements in a straight line, whereas **Selection** decides which set of instructions to execute based on a condition.

### 3. How does an Iteration control structure work?

Iteration repeats a set of instructions multiple times based on a condition or a counter, reducing repetitive code.

### 4. Can Sequence be combined with other control structures?

Yes, Sequence often works alongside Selection and Iteration to define more complex logic.

### 5. What is an example of a Selection structure?

An example would be using an `if-else` statement to check if a number is positive or negative.

### 6. When would you use Iteration in a program?

Iteration is useful when you need to perform a task multiple times, such as looping through an array or counting down from a number.

### 7. How does an `if-else` statement work?

The `if-else` statement checks a condition, and if it's true, the first block of code is executed; otherwise, the `else` block is executed.

### 8. What are the benefits of using Iteration over repeated code?

Using Iteration makes the code more concise and easier to maintain, as you don't have to manually write the same code multiple times.

### 9. Can an `if` statement contain multiple conditions?

Yes, using `else if` or `elif`, you can check multiple conditions in a single `if` block.

### 10. How do you stop an iteration prematurely?

You can use the `break` statement to stop a loop immediately, regardless of the loop's condition.

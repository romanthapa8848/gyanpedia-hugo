The **Play Method** is a natural and enjoyable way for children to learn. Through play, children are able to explore, experiment, and understand the world around them. In Nepal, play-based learning has been increasingly recognized as an effective method for fostering creativity, social interaction, and problem-solving skills among young learners.

### 2. **Storytelling as a Tool for Learning**

# Instantaneous Velocity and Acceleration

In the study of motion (kinematics), instantaneous velocity and instantaneous acceleration are crucial concepts to analyze the motion of objects at specific moments in time.

---

## Instantaneous Velocity

**Definition**: Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of an object at a particular moment in time. It is a vector quantity that gives the rate of change of displacement with respect to time.

- **Mathematical Expression**:  
  If the position of a particle is given by $x(t)$, the instantaneous velocity $v(t)$ is the derivative of displacement with respect to time:  
  $$v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt}$$

- **Direction**: The direction of instantaneous velocity is along the tangent to the path of motion at the given point.

### Example:  
If $x(t) = 5t^2 + 2t$, then:  
$$v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = 10t + 2$$  
At $t = 2 \, \text{s}$, the instantaneous velocity is:  
$$v(2) = 10(2) + 2 = 22 \, \text{m/s}$$

## Instantaneous Acceleration

**Definition**: Instantaneous acceleration is the acceleration of an object at a specific moment in time. It is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.

- **Mathematical Expression**:  
  If the velocity of a particle is given by $v(t)$, the instantaneous acceleration $a(t)$ is the derivative of velocity with respect to time:  
  $$a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt}$$  

- **Direction**: The direction of instantaneous acceleration is along the direction of the change in velocity.

### Example:  
If $v(t) = 10t + 2$, then:  
$$a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = 10$$  
At any instant, the acceleration is $10 \, \text{m/s}^2$, indicating uniform acceleration.

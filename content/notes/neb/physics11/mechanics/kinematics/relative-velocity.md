# Relative Velocity

Relative velocity is a measure of the velocity of one object as observed from another moving object. It helps us understand how the motion of one object appears relative to another.

## Concept of Relative Velocity

### 1. **Definition**
The relative velocity of an object $A$ with respect to another object $B$ is given by:
$$
\vec{v}_{AB} = \vec{v}_A - \vec{v}_B
$$
where:
- $\vec{v}_A$ is the velocity of object $A$,
- $\vec{v}_B$ is the velocity of object $B$.

### 2. **Key Points**
- Relative velocity is a **vector quantity**.
- It depends on both the **magnitude** and **direction** of velocities.

## Cases of Relative Velocity

1. **Objects Moving in the Same Direction**
   - If two objects move in the same direction, the relative velocity is the difference of their speeds:
   $$
   \vec{v}_{AB} = |\vec{v}_A - \vec{v}_B|
   $$

   **Example**:  
   If car $A$ is moving at $60 \, \text{km/h}$ and car $B$ at $40 \, \text{km/h}$ in the same direction:
   $$
   \vec{v}_{AB} = 60 - 40 = 20 \, \text{km/h}
   $$

2. **Objects Moving in Opposite Directions**
   - If two objects move in opposite directions, the relative velocity is the sum of their speeds:
   $$
   \vec{v}_{AB} = |\vec{v}_A + \vec{v}_B|
   $$

   **Example**:  
   If car $A$ is moving at $60 \, \text{km/h}$ and car $B$ at $40 \, \text{km/h}$ in opposite directions:
   $$
   \vec{v}_{AB} = 60 + 40 = 100 \, \text{km/h}
   $$

3. **Perpendicular Motion (e.g., Riverboat Problem)**
   - When two objects move at an angle, their relative velocity is the resultant of their vectors:
   $$
   \vec{v}_{AB} = \sqrt{v_A^2 + v_B^2}
   $$

## Summary

- Relative velocity explains how the motion of one object appears from another moving reference point.
- It is calculated using the formula:
  $$
  \vec{v}_{AB} = \vec{v}_A - \vec{v}_B
  $$
- The concept is used in solving problems like **collisions**, **riverboat motion**, and **airplane motion in wind**.

## FAQs

**1. What is relative velocity?**  
It is the velocity of one object as observed from another moving object.

**2. How is relative velocity calculated?**  
The formula is:
$$
\vec{v}_{AB} = \vec{v}_A - \vec{v}_B
$$

**3. Is relative velocity a scalar or vector quantity?**  
Relative velocity is a vector quantity.

**4. What happens to relative velocity if two objects move at the same speed in the same direction?**  
The relative velocity is zero because:
$$
\vec{v}_{AB} = \vec{v}_A - \vec{v}_B = 0
$$

**5. Can relative velocity be negative?**  
Yes, relative velocity can be negative if the direction of motion is opposite.

**6. What is the relative velocity of two objects moving in opposite directions?**  
It is the sum of their speeds:
$$
\vec{v}_{AB} = |\vec{v}_A + \vec{v}_B|
$$

**7. What is the significance of relative velocity in collisions?**  
It helps determine the impact velocity, which is crucial for analyzing collisions.

**8. How is relative velocity used in riverboat problems?**  
It helps calculate the resultant velocity and direction of the boat relative to the riverbank.

**9. Can the relative velocity be greater than the actual velocities of the objects?**  
Yes, especially when objects move in opposite directions.

**10. How is relative velocity used in real life?**  
It is used in navigation, collision analysis, and understanding motion in dynamic systems.

# Work-Energy Theorem; Kinetic and Potential Energy

The **Work-Energy Theorem** states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. This theorem forms the foundation for understanding the relationship between work and energy.

## Work-Energy Theorem

The **Work-Energy Theorem** expresses the connection between work and kinetic energy. It states that the total work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. Mathematically, the work-energy theorem is expressed as:

$$
W = \Delta KE
$$

Where:
- $W$ is the work done on the object (in joules, J),
- $\Delta KE$ is the change in kinetic energy of the object.

If a constant force $F$ is applied to an object moving with an initial velocity $v_i$ and it accelerates to a final velocity $v_f$ over a distance $d$, the work done on the object is:

$$
W = F \cdot d = \frac{1}{2}m(v_f^2 - v_i^2)
$$

Where:
- $m$ is the mass of the object (in kilograms, kg),
- $v_i$ is the initial velocity (in meters per second, m/s),
- $v_f$ is the final velocity (in meters per second, m/s),
- $d$ is the distance over which the force acts (in meters, m).

### Example:

If a car of mass 1000 kg accelerates from a velocity of 5 m/s to 15 m/s, the work done on the car is:

$$
W = \frac{1}{2} \times 1000 \times (15^2 - 5^2) = 1000 \times (225 - 25) = 1000 \times 200 = 200,000 \, \text{J}
$$

Thus, 200,000 joules of work is done to accelerate the car.

## Kinetic Energy

**Kinetic energy** (KE) is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. It depends on the mass and velocity of the object. The formula for kinetic energy is:

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
$$

Where:
- $KE$ is the kinetic energy (in joules, J),
- $m$ is the mass of the object (in kilograms, kg),
- $v$ is the velocity of the object (in meters per second, m/s).

### Example:

A 2 kg object moving with a velocity of 4 m/s has a kinetic energy of:

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4^2 = 1 \times 16 = 16 \, \text{J}
$$

Thus, the object has 16 joules of kinetic energy.

## Potential Energy

**Potential energy** (PE) is the energy possessed by an object due to its position or configuration. The most common form of potential energy is **gravitational potential energy**, which depends on the height of an object relative to the ground.

The formula for gravitational potential energy is:

$$
PE = mgh
$$

Where:
- $PE$ is the potential energy (in joules, J),
- $m$ is the mass of the object (in kilograms, kg),
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$ on Earth),
- $h$ is the height of the object above the ground (in meters, m).

### Example:

If a 5 kg object is lifted to a height of 10 meters, the gravitational potential energy is:

$$
PE = 5 \times 9.8 \times 10 = 490 \, \text{J}
$$

Thus, the object has 490 joules of potential energy.

## Conservation of Mechanical Energy

The **conservation of mechanical energy** states that the total mechanical energy (kinetic energy + potential energy) of an object remains constant in the absence of non-conservative forces (such as friction). Mathematically:

$$
KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f
$$

Where:
- $KE_i$ and $PE_i$ are the initial kinetic and potential energies,
- $KE_f$ and $PE_f$ are the final kinetic and potential energies.

This principle is useful in solving problems related to energy conservation in systems without energy loss due to friction or air resistance.

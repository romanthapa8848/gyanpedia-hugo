# Applications of Banking

The term **banking** refers to the technique of **superelevation**, which is the tilting or banking of the roadway on curves. It helps in ensuring the safe and efficient movement of vehicles on curved roads. Below are the key applications of banking in roads:

---

## 1. **Superelevation in Curved Roads**

Superelevation is the transverse slope provided to the roadway on curves to counteract the centrifugal force acting on a vehicle. The inward tilt helps maintain vehicle stability and reduce the risk of skidding. The banking angle of the road is designed based on:

- **Speed of Vehicles**: Higher speed requires a higher banking angle.
- **Radius of the Curve**: A smaller radius requires a greater banking angle.
  
This application helps vehicles to travel around curves without sliding outward, making roads safer for both high-speed and low-speed traffic.

## 2. **Reducing Centrifugal Force**

When a vehicle moves along a curve, the centrifugal force pushes the vehicle away from the center of the curve. The banking of the road helps reduce the impact of this centrifugal force by providing an angle that balances the forces acting on the vehicle. This helps:

- **Minimize the risk of accidents** by maintaining better grip and stability.
- **Improve the comfort of drivers and passengers**, as it reduces the likelihood of jerks and skidding.

## 3. **Improved Water Drainage**

By banking the road, the surface can be designed in such a way that it directs rainwater away from the road surface. This improves:

- **Road surface longevity** by preventing water accumulation, which could lead to erosion or damage to the road.
- **Safety** by ensuring that water does not accumulate in the inner lanes of curves, reducing the chances of hydroplaning.

---

## 4. **Effective for High-Speed Roads**

In highways and expressways where vehicles travel at high speeds, banking becomes crucial. Proper superelevation helps vehicles maintain higher speeds on curves without sacrificing safety. This is especially important in:

- **Interstate highways**: For smooth and safe transitions between different road sections.
- **High-speed train tracks**: In some cases, the concept of banking is applied to railway tracks to help trains maintain speed safely around curves.

---

## 5. **Cost-Effective Road Design**

Banking roads effectively can be cost-effective, as it can:

- **Reduce the need for frequent maintenance** by distributing the forces more evenly across the road.
- **Allow for smaller radius curves** on roads without compromising safety, which is especially useful in hilly or mountainous regions where space is limited.

## Summary

Banking in roads, or superelevation, is an essential aspect of road design. It improves vehicle safety, reduces the likelihood of accidents, enhances driver comfort, and helps with efficient water drainage. It is widely applied in designing curves, particularly on highways, intersections, and mountainous roads, to ensure smooth and stable vehicle movement.

## FAQs

**1. What is banking in road design?**  
Banking, or superelevation, refers to the practice of tilting the roadway on curves to improve vehicle stability and safety.

**2. Why is banking important on curved roads?**  
It helps counteract the centrifugal force acting on vehicles, reducing the risk of skidding and improving road safety.

**3. What factors determine the angle of banking?**  
The angle depends on the speed of the vehicles and the radius of the curve.

**4. Does banking help with water drainage on roads?**  
Yes, it directs water away from the road surface, improving drainage and reducing the risk of hydroplaning.

**5. Is banking used in all types of roads?**  
It is particularly used in curved sections of highways, expressways, and roads in mountainous regions where vehicle speed is high.

**6. What happens if the banking angle is too steep?**  
A banking angle that is too steep can make the road uncomfortable for vehicles at lower speeds and may lead to unsafe conditions.

**7. How does superelevation affect road maintenance?**  
Proper superelevation can reduce the wear and tear on the road, leading to fewer maintenance requirements.

**8. Can banking be used for railway tracks?**  
Yes, superelevation is sometimes used on railway curves to help trains maintain high speeds safely.

**9. What is the effect of superelevation on driver comfort?**  
It improves comfort by reducing jerks and skidding, especially at higher speeds on curves.

**10. How does banking improve road safety?**  
It helps vehicles maintain a stable grip on the road and reduces the likelihood of accidents on curves.

# Angular Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration

In circular motion, the motion of an object follows a circular path. To describe this motion, we use angular quantities like **angular displacement**, **angular velocity**, and **angular acceleration**. These quantities are analogous to linear displacement, velocity, and acceleration but apply to rotating objects.

## Angular Displacement

**Angular displacement** refers to the angle through which an object moves along a circular path. It is the angle between the initial and final positions of a point on the rotating body, measured in radians.

### Formula for Angular Displacement:
If an object rotates through an angle $\theta$ in a time $t$, the angular displacement is simply the angle swept by the object in radians.

- **Unit**: Radians (rad)
  
  $$
  \theta = \theta_f - \theta_i
  $$

Where:
- $\theta$ is the angular displacement
- $\theta_f$ is the final angular position
- $\theta_i$ is the initial angular position

### Example:
If an object rotates from an angle of $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$, the angular displacement is $90^\circ$, which is equivalent to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians.

## Angular Velocity

**Angular velocity** refers to the rate of change of angular displacement with respect to time. It tells us how quickly an object is rotating. 

### Formula for Angular Velocity:
The average angular velocity $\omega$ is given by the change in angular displacement over time:

$$
\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$

Where:
- $\omega$ is the angular velocity (in radians per second, rad/s)
- $\Delta \theta$ is the change in angular displacement (in radians)
- $\Delta t$ is the change in time

For **uniform circular motion**, the angular velocity is constant, and the instantaneous angular velocity is:

$$
\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$

Where:
- $d\theta$ is an infinitesimally small change in angular displacement
- $dt$ is the infinitesimally small change in time

### Example:
If an object completes one full rotation (an angular displacement of $2\pi$ radians) in $T$ seconds, the angular velocity is:

$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}
$$

## Angular Acceleration

**Angular acceleration** refers to the rate at which angular velocity changes with time. It measures how quickly the rotational speed is increasing or decreasing.

### Formula for Angular Acceleration:
The average angular acceleration $\alpha$ is given by the change in angular velocity over time:

$$
\alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}
$$

Where:
- $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration (in radians per second squared, rad/s²)
- $\Delta \omega$ is the change in angular velocity
- $\Delta t$ is the change in time

For **uniform angular acceleration**, the angular velocity changes at a constant rate, and the instantaneous angular acceleration is:

$$
\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}
$$

### Example:
If an object's angular velocity increases from $\omega_i$ to $\omega_f$ in a time interval $t$, the angular acceleration is:

$$
\alpha = \frac{\omega_f - \omega_i}{t}
$$

## Relationship Between Linear and Angular Quantities

In circular motion, there is a relationship between the **linear** quantities (displacement, velocity, acceleration) and **angular** quantities (angular displacement, angular velocity, angular acceleration):

- **Linear displacement** $s$ is related to angular displacement $\theta$ by:

  $$
  s = r\theta
  $$

Where:
- $r$ is the radius of the circular path.

- **Linear velocity** $v$ is related to angular velocity $\omega$ by:

  $$
  v = r\omega
  $$

- **Linear acceleration** $a$ is related to angular acceleration $\alpha$ by:

  $$
  a = r\alpha
  $$

Where:
- $r$ is the radius of the circular path.

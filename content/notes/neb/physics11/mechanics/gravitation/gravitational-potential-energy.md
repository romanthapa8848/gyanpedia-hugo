# Gravitational Potential and Gravitational Potential Energy  

Gravitational potential and potential energy are concepts related to the work done by gravity. They are crucial for understanding energy transformations in gravitational fields.  

---

## Gravitational Potential  

### Definition  

Gravitational potential ($V$) at a point is defined as the work done in bringing a unit mass from infinity to that point in a gravitational field.  

### Formula  

$$ V = - \frac{GM}{r} $$  

where:  
- $V$ = gravitational potential (J/kg)  
- $G$ = gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$)  
- $M$ = mass of the source (kg)  
- $r$ = distance from the source mass to the point (m)  

### Key Points  

1. Gravitational potential is scalar and always negative due to the attractive nature of gravity.  
2. Its value increases (becomes less negative) as the distance from the source mass increases.

## Gravitational Potential Energy  

### Definition  

Gravitational potential energy ($U$) of a system is the energy stored due to the gravitational attraction between two masses.  

### Formula  

$$ U = - \frac{GMm}{r} $$  

where:  
- $U$ = gravitational potential energy (J)  
- $G$ = gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$)  
- $M$ = source mass (kg)  
- $m$ = mass of the object (kg)  
- $r$ = distance between the two masses (m)

## Relationship Between $V$ and $U$  

Gravitational potential energy is the product of gravitational potential and mass:  
$$ U = mV $$  

---

## Key Features  

1. **Negative Sign**: The negative sign indicates that work is required to separate the masses to infinity.  
2. **Reference Point**: Gravitational potential and potential energy are zero at infinity.  
3. **System Dependence**: Potential energy depends on the masses involved and their separation.

## Applications  

1. **Escape Velocity**: Calculating the minimum velocity required for an object to escape a planet's gravity.  
2. **Orbital Mechanics**: Understanding satellite motion and energy requirements.  
3. **Energy Conservation**: Analyzing mechanical energy transformations in gravitational fields.  
4. **Astrophysics**: Studying gravitational interactions in celestial bodies.

## Summary  

- **Gravitational Potential ($V$)**: Work done per unit mass to bring a mass to a point in the gravitational field.  
- **Gravitational Potential Energy ($U$)**: Energy stored due to the gravitational attraction between masses.  
- Both are negative because of the attractive nature of gravity.

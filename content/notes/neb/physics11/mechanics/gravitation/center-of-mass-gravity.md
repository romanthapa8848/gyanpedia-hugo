# Centre of Mass and Centre of Gravity  

The **Centre of Mass (COM)** and **Centre of Gravity (COG)** are two key points in a body that simplify its motion and interaction with gravitational fields.

---

## Centre of Mass (COM)  

### Definition  

The **centre of mass** is the point at which the entire mass of a system or body can be considered to be concentrated for analyzing its motion.  

### Formula  

For a system of particles:  

$$ \vec{R}_{\text{cm}} = \frac{\sum m_i \vec{r}_i}{\sum m_i} $$  

where:  
- $\vec{R}_{\text{cm}}$ = position vector of the centre of mass  
- $m_i$ = mass of the $i$th particle  
- $\vec{r}_i$ = position vector of the $i$th particle  

### Key Points  

1. **Uniform Mass Distribution**: For a uniform body, the COM lies at the geometric center.  
2. **Non-Uniform Mass Distribution**: For an irregular body, the COM shifts towards the heavier portion.

## Centre of Gravity (COG)  

### Definition  

The **centre of gravity** is the point at which the entire weight of a body can be considered to act when analyzing its interaction with gravity.  

### Difference Between COM and COG  

1. **COM** depends only on mass distribution, whereas **COG** depends on the weight distribution and gravitational field.  
2. In a uniform gravitational field, COM and COG coincide.

### Key Differences  

| Property               | Centre of Mass (COM)                      | Centre of Gravity (COG)                  |  
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| Definition             | Point where the total mass appears concentrated. | Point where the total weight acts.      |  
| Depends on             | Mass distribution.                       | Gravitational field and weight.         |  
| Position in Uniform Field | Same as COG.                            | Same as COM.                            |

## Applications  

1. **COM** is crucial in analyzing the motion of bodies in mechanics.  
2. **COG** is essential in understanding stability and equilibrium.  
3. Used in designing structures, vehicles, and aircraft for stability.

## Summary  

- The COM is the mass-based balance point.  
- The COG is the weight-based balance point.  
- In a uniform gravitational field, they are the same.

## FAQs  

**1. What is the COM?**  
The centre of mass is the point where the entire mass of a body or system is considered concentrated.  

**2. What is the COG?**  
The centre of gravity is the point where the entire weight of a body acts.  

**3. Are COM and COG always the same?**  
No, they coincide only in a uniform gravitational field.  

**4. Can COM lie outside the body?**  
Yes, for certain shapes like a ring or hollow sphere, the COM can lie outside the body.  

**5. What happens to the COM when a body is cut into two?**  
The COM of each part will shift according to the new mass distribution.  

**6. How is the COM of a system of particles calculated?**  
Using the formula:  
$$ \vec{R}_{\text{cm}} = \frac{\sum m_i \vec{r}_i}{\sum m_i} $$  

**7. Can COG lie outside the body?**  
Yes, for certain irregular bodies or systems.  

**8. What is the significance of COM in motion?**  
COM helps simplify the analysis of motion by treating a system as a point mass.  

**9. How does the Earth's gravity affect the COG?**  
Variations in Earth's gravity can shift the COG slightly.  

**10. What is the difference between COM and COG in a non-uniform field?**  
In a non-uniform field, COM is purely based on mass, while COG depends on the varying gravitational pull.

# Newton’s Law of Gravitation

Newton’s law of gravitation explains the universal force of attraction between any two bodies in the universe. It is fundamental to understanding planetary motion, tides, and satellite dynamics.

---

## The Law

Newton’s law of gravitation states:

> Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

The gravitational force $F$ is given by:  

$$ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$  

where:  
- $F$ = gravitational force between two bodies  
- $m_1, m_2$ = masses of the two bodies  
- $r$ = distance between their centers  
- $G$ = universal gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$)

## Characteristics of Gravitational Force

1. **Mutual Force**: The gravitational force is mutual, meaning both bodies exert an equal and opposite force on each other.
2. **Long-range Force**: Acts over large distances without requiring a medium.
3. **Weak Force**: It is the weakest of the fundamental forces.
4. **Inverse-square Law**: The force decreases as the square of the distance increases.

## Significance of $G$  

The universal gravitational constant $G$ is a proportionality factor that makes the equation dimensionally consistent. It has the value:  
$$ G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2 $$

## Applications of Newton's Law of Gravitation

1. **Planetary Motion**: Explains the orbits of planets around the Sun.  
2. **Tides**: Responsible for ocean tides due to the gravitational pull of the Moon.  
3. **Satellites**: Helps calculate the force needed to keep satellites in orbit.  
4. **Weight**: Determines the gravitational force acting on objects on Earth's surface.  
5. **Astrophysics**: Used to study stellar formation, black holes, and galaxy dynamics.

## Summary  

Newton’s law of gravitation is a universal force that governs the interaction between all masses. It forms the basis for understanding celestial mechanics and many natural phenomena on Earth.

# Geostationary Satellite  

A **geostationary satellite** is a satellite that orbits the Earth at the same rotational speed as the Earth's rotation. This results in the satellite remaining in a fixed position relative to a specific point on the Earth's surface. These satellites are primarily used for communication, weather forecasting, and surveillance.

## Characteristics of Geostationary Satellites  

- **Orbital Period**: A geostationary satellite orbits the Earth once every 24 hours, which matches the Earth's rotational period. This ensures that the satellite stays above the same point on the Earth's surface.
  
- **Orbit Height**: The satellite is placed at an altitude of approximately 35,786 km (22,236 miles) above the equator. This is called the **geostationary orbit**.

- **Equatorial Orbit**: Geostationary satellites must orbit along the equator, as their orbital motion must match the Earth's rotational motion at the equator.

- **Fixed Position**: Because of the combination of the satellite’s orbital period and orbit height, a geostationary satellite remains stationary over a particular point on the Earth’s surface. This is why they are often used for communication and broadcasting.

## Derivation of Orbital Velocity for Geostationary Satellite  

To derive the orbital velocity of a geostationary satellite, we consider the balance between the gravitational force and the centripetal force acting on the satellite.

The gravitational force acting on the satellite is:

$$ F_{\text{gravity}} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$

where:  
- $G$ = gravitational constant  
- $M$ = mass of the Earth  
- $m$ = mass of the satellite  
- $r$ = radius of the orbit from the center of the Earth  

The centripetal force required to keep the satellite in orbit is:

$$ F_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{mv^2}{r} $$

where:  
- $v$ = orbital velocity of the satellite  

For the satellite to stay in orbit, these two forces must be equal:

$$ \frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r} $$

Simplifying the equation, we find:

$$ v^2 = \frac{GM}{r} $$

Thus, the orbital velocity is:

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} $$

For a geostationary satellite, the value of $r$ is approximately $35,786$ km, and the orbital velocity is approximately $3.07$ km/s.

## Applications of Geostationary Satellites  

1. **Communication**: Geostationary satellites are widely used for television broadcasting, telephone communication, and internet services. Since they stay above the same location, they provide continuous coverage to specific areas.

2. **Weather Forecasting**: These satellites are ideal for monitoring weather patterns over a specific region due to their fixed position in the sky. They can continuously observe and capture data on weather changes.

3. **Surveillance**: Geostationary satellites are used for surveillance and defense purposes, allowing continuous monitoring of certain regions.

4. **Navigation**: GPS satellites are often in geostationary orbits, providing accurate positioning data for navigation systems.

## Limitations of Geostationary Satellites  

- **Fixed Location**: Since they remain in one location, they can only cover a specific area on the Earth's surface, typically around the equator. They cannot provide global coverage.
  
- **Orbital Height**: The high altitude of geostationary satellites (around 35,786 km) leads to higher launch costs compared to low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites.

- **Signal Latency**: The distance between the satellite and the Earth's surface results in a slight delay in signals, making them less ideal for some real-time applications.

## Summary  

- Geostationary satellites remain stationary relative to the Earth's surface due to their orbital velocity and height.  
- They orbit at an altitude of approximately 35,786 km above the equator, with an orbital period of 24 hours.  
- They are used in communication, weather forecasting, and surveillance.  
- The orbital velocity of a geostationary satellite is approximately $3.07$ km/s.

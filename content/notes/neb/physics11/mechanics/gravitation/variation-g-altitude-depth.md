# Variation in the Value of 'g' Due to Altitude and Depth  

The acceleration due to gravity, $g$, is not constant across the Earth's surface. It varies with altitude (height above Earth's surface) and depth (distance below Earth's surface).

## Variation in $g$ Due to Altitude  

### Formula  

For an object at altitude $h$ above the Earth's surface:  

$$ g_h = g \left( \frac{R}{R + h} \right)^2 $$  

where:  
- $g_h$ = value of $g$ at height $h$  
- $g$ = value of $g$ on Earth's surface  
- $R$ = Earth's radius  
- $h$ = altitude above Earth's surface  

### Key Points  

1. As $h$ increases, $g_h$ decreases.  
2. For $h \ll R$ (small height compared to Earth's radius), the change can be approximated as:  
   $$ \frac{\Delta g}{g} \approx \frac{-2h}{R} $$

## Variation in $g$ Due to Depth  

### Formula  

For an object at depth $d$ below the Earth's surface:  

$$ g_d = g \left( 1 - \frac{d}{R} \right) $$  

where:  
- $g_d$ = value of $g$ at depth $d$  
- $g$ = value of $g$ on Earth's surface  
- $R$ = Earth's radius  
- $d$ = depth below Earth's surface  

### Key Points  

1. $g$ decreases linearly with depth, assuming uniform density of the Earth.  
2. At the Earth's center ($d = R$), $g = 0$.

### Comparison  

| Variation Type | Formula                           | Key Behavior                               |  
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|  
| Altitude       | $g_h = g \left( \frac{R}{R + h} \right)^2$ | $g$ decreases with altitude (inverse-square law). |  
| Depth          | $g_d = g \left( 1 - \frac{d}{R} \right)$   | $g$ decreases linearly with depth.        |

## Applications  

1. **Satellite Launch**: Calculating $g$ at higher altitudes is crucial for orbital mechanics.  
2. **Mining**: Understanding $g$ at various depths helps in designing underground structures.  
3. **Geophysics**: Changes in $g$ with altitude and depth help in studying Earth's structure.

## Summary  

- $g$ decreases with both altitude and depth.  
- At high altitudes, $g$ decreases following an inverse-square law.  
- At depths, $g$ decreases linearly and becomes zero at Earth's center.

## FAQs  

**1. Why does $g$ vary with altitude?**  
$g$ decreases with altitude because gravitational force weakens as distance from Earth's center increases.  

**2. Why does $g$ vary with depth?**  
$g$ decreases with depth because the effective mass attracting the object reduces.  

**3. What happens to $g$ at the Earth's center?**  
At the Earth's center, $g = 0$ because there is no net gravitational force.  

**4. What is the approximate change in $g$ for small heights?**  
For small heights, $g$ changes approximately by $\frac{-2h}{R}$.  

**5. Does $g$ decrease faster with altitude or depth?**  
$g$ decreases faster with altitude since it follows an inverse-square law, compared to the linear decrease with depth.  

**6. How does the Earth's shape affect $g$?**  
The Earth's oblate shape causes $g$ to be slightly higher at the poles than at the equator.  

**7. Can $g$ ever be negative?**  
No, $g$ cannot be negative; it approaches zero as depth reaches Earth's center or at infinite altitude.  

**8. What factors influence $g$ besides altitude and depth?**  
Latitude, Earth's rotation, and local density variations affect $g$.  

**9. Is $g$ constant across Earth's surface?**  
No, $g$ varies slightly due to Earth's shape and rotation.  

**10. How is the formula for $g$ at altitude derived?**  
It is derived using Newton's law of gravitation, considering the distance from Earth's center.

# Potential and Kinetic Energy of the Satellite  

When a satellite orbits a planet, its total energy is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy. The nature of these energies depends on the satellite's position and velocity in orbit.

## Potential Energy of the Satellite  

The **gravitational potential energy** ($P.E.$) of a satellite is the energy due to its position in the gravitational field of the planet. The gravitational potential energy is given by:

$$ P.E. = -\frac{GMm}{r} $$

where:  
- $M$ = mass of the planet  
- $m$ = mass of the satellite  
- $r$ = distance between the center of the planet and the satellite  

The negative sign indicates that the potential energy is lower when the satellite is closer to the planet, and it becomes less negative as the satellite moves farther away.

## Kinetic Energy of the Satellite  

The **kinetic energy** ($ K.E. $) of a satellite in orbit is the energy due to its motion. It is given by the formula:

$$ K.E. = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$

where:  
- $m$ = mass of the satellite  
- $v$ = velocity of the satellite  

For a satellite in a circular orbit, the velocity can be derived using the gravitational force:

$$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r} $$  

Solving for $v$, we get:

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} $$  

Substitute this value of $v$ into the kinetic energy formula:

$$ K.E. = \frac{1}{2}m \left(\frac{GM}{r}\right) $$

Thus, the kinetic energy of the satellite becomes:

$$ K.E. = \frac{GMm}{2r} $$

## Total Mechanical Energy of the Satellite  

The **total energy** ($E$) of a satellite in orbit is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies:

$$ E = K.E. + P.E. $$

Substituting the formulas for $K.E.$ and $P.E.$:

$$ E = \frac{GMm}{2r} - \frac{GMm}{r} $$  

Simplifying:

$$ E = -\frac{GMm}{2r} $$

Thus, the total mechanical energy of a satellite in orbit is negative, indicating that the satellite is bound to the planet by the gravitational force.

## Relationship Between Kinetic and Potential Energy  

For a satellite in orbit, the kinetic energy and potential energy are related by:

$$ K.E. = -\frac{1}{2} P.E. $$

This relationship shows that the kinetic energy is always half the magnitude of the potential energy, but with the opposite sign.

## FAQs  

**1. What is the formula for the kinetic energy of a satellite?**  
The kinetic energy of a satellite is given by $K.E. = \frac{GMm}{2r}$.  

**2. How is potential energy of a satellite defined?**  
The potential energy is given by $P.E. = -\frac{GMm}{r}$.  

**3. Why is the potential energy of a satellite negative?**  
The potential energy is negative because the satellite is bound to the planet by the gravitational force.  

**4. What is the total mechanical energy of a satellite?**  
The total mechanical energy is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2r}$.  

**5. How are kinetic energy and potential energy related for a satellite?**  
Kinetic energy is always half the magnitude of potential energy but with the opposite sign: $K.E. = -\frac{1}{2} P.E$.  

**6. Does the total energy of a satellite depend on its mass?**  
Yes, the total energy of a satellite depends on both its mass and the mass of the planet.  

**7. What happens to the total energy if the satellite moves farther from the planet?**  
As the satellite moves farther from the planet, the magnitude of its total energy becomes smaller, but it remains negative.  

**8. How does the gravitational force affect the satellite's energy?**  
The gravitational force results in negative potential energy and binds the satellite in orbit, making the total energy negative.  

**9. Is the kinetic energy of a satellite ever zero?**  
No, unless the satellite has escaped the gravitational field of the planet (i.e., it reaches escape velocity), its kinetic energy is never zero.  

**10. Can a satellite's energy change?**  
Yes, if the satellite changes its orbit or is influenced by external forces, its energy can change.

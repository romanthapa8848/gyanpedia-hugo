# Motion of a Satellite: Orbital Velocity and Time Period  

Satellites revolve around planets due to the gravitational force acting as the centripetal force. The motion of a satellite is determined by its **orbital velocity** and **time period**.

---

## Orbital Velocity  

### Definition  

The **orbital velocity** is the minimum velocity required by a satellite to maintain its orbit around a planet.  

### Derivation  

For a satellite of mass $m$ orbiting a planet of mass $M$ at a distance $r$ (from the center of the planet):  

The gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force:  

$$ \frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r} $$  

Simplifying:  

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} $$  

where:  
- $v$ = orbital velocity  
- $G$ = gravitational constant ($6.67 \times 10^{-11}$ N·m$^2$/kg$^2$)  
- $M$ = mass of the planet  
- $r$ = orbital radius (sum of the planet's radius and the satellite's height above the planet's surface)  

### Key Points  

1. Orbital velocity depends on the planet's mass ($M$) and the satellite's orbital radius ($r$).  
2. For Earth, near the surface, $v \approx 7.9$ km/s.

## Time Period of a Satellite  

### Definition  

The **time period** of a satellite is the time it takes to complete one revolution around the planet.  

### Derivation  

The time period is given by:  

$$ T = \frac{\text{Circumference of orbit}}{\text{Orbital velocity}} $$  

For a circular orbit of radius $r$:  

$$ T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} $$  

Substitute $v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$:  

$$ T = \frac{2\pi r}{\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}} $$  

Simplifying:  

$$ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}} $$  

where:  
- $T$ = time period of the satellite  
- $r$ = orbital radius  
- $M$ = mass of the planet  
- $G$ = gravitational constant  

### Key Points  

1. Time period increases with orbital radius ($r$).  
2. For geostationary satellites, $T = 24$ hours.

## Applications of Orbital Velocity and Time Period  

1. **Satellite Communication**: Accurate calculation of $v$ and $T$ is essential for satellites like GPS and geostationary satellites.  
2. **Space Missions**: Orbital mechanics rely on these calculations to position satellites effectively.  
3. **Earth Observation**: Polar satellites with shorter time periods monitor Earth's surface.  

---

## Summary  

- **Orbital Velocity**: $v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$  
- **Time Period**: $T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}}$  
- These equations describe the stable motion of satellites.

## FAQs  

**1. What is orbital velocity?**  
Orbital velocity is the minimum velocity required for a satellite to stay in orbit.  

**2. Does orbital velocity depend on the satellite's mass?**  
No, it depends only on the planet's mass and the orbital radius.  

**3. What is the orbital velocity near Earth's surface?**  
Near the Earth's surface, the orbital velocity is approximately 7.9 km/s.  

**4. What is the time period of a geostationary satellite?**  
The time period of a geostationary satellite is 24 hours.  

**5. Why is orbital velocity independent of the satellite's mass?**  
The mass of the satellite cancels out in the equation for orbital velocity.  

**6. How does the orbital radius affect the time period?**  
The time period increases with the orbital radius as $T \propto \sqrt{r^3}$.  

**7. What is the significance of the time period of satellites?**  
The time period determines how frequently a satellite passes over the same location on Earth.  

**8. Can orbital velocity vary for a satellite in a circular orbit?**  
No, it remains constant for a circular orbit.  

**9. What happens if a satellite's velocity is less than orbital velocity?**  
The satellite will fall back to the planet due to insufficient centripetal force.  

**10. Why are higher orbits slower?**  
Higher orbits require longer time periods due to larger radii and weaker gravitational pull.

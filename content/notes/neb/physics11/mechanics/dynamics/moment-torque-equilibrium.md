# Moment, Torque, and Equilibrium

In rotational motion, the concepts of moment, torque, and equilibrium are essential in understanding how forces affect the rotation of objects. These concepts are widely used in mechanical engineering, physics, and everyday life.

## Moment of a Force

The **moment** (or **torque**) of a force about a point is the measure of the force's ability to cause rotation about that point. It is calculated as the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the point of rotation to the line of action of the force.

### Formula for Moment

The moment of a force $F$ about a point $O$ is given by:

$$
M = F \times d
$$

Where:  
- $M$ is the moment of force.  
- $F$ is the applied force.  
- $d$ is the perpendicular distance from the point of rotation to the line of action of the force.

The unit of moment is $N\cdot m$ (Newton-meter).

### Direction of Moment

The direction of the moment is determined by the right-hand rule:
- If the force tends to rotate the object in a counterclockwise direction, the moment is positive.
- If the force tends to rotate the object in a clockwise direction, the moment is negative.

## Torque

Torque is a specific type of moment that refers to the rotational effect produced by a force acting on an object. It is the rotational counterpart of force in linear motion.

### Formula for Torque

The torque $\tau$ produced by a force $F$ acting at a distance $r$ from the pivot point (also known as the lever arm) is:

$$
\tau = F \times r
$$

Where:  
- $\tau$ is the torque.  
- $F$ is the applied force.  
- $r$ is the perpendicular distance (lever arm) from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied.

Like moment, torque is also measured in $N\cdot m$.

### Factors Affecting Torque

1. **Magnitude of the Force**: The greater the force, the greater the torque.
2. **Length of the Lever Arm**: The longer the distance from the axis of rotation, the greater the torque.
3. **Angle of Application**: The torque is maximum when the force is applied perpendicular to the lever arm.

## Equilibrium

An object is in **equilibrium** when there is no net force or net torque acting on it. This means that the object will not accelerate or rotate. There are two types of equilibrium:

### 1. **Translational Equilibrium**

An object is in translational equilibrium when the sum of all the forces acting on it is zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
\sum F = 0
$$

Where:  
- $\sum F$ is the sum of all the forces acting on the object.

This condition ensures that there is no linear acceleration of the object.

### 2. **Rotational Equilibrium**

An object is in rotational equilibrium when the sum of all the torques acting on it is zero. This is expressed as:

$$
\sum \tau = 0
$$

Where:  
- $\sum \tau$ is the sum of all torques acting on the object.

This condition ensures that the object does not rotate or undergo angular acceleration.

## Applications of Torque and Equilibrium

### 1. **Seesaw or Balance Scale**

In a seesaw, the torques acting on both sides must balance for the seesaw to be in equilibrium. The force (weight) on each side is multiplied by the distance from the pivot. If the torques on both sides are equal, the seesaw remains level.

### 2. **Wrenches**

A wrench works by applying torque to loosen or tighten bolts. The longer the wrench handle, the greater the torque for the same applied force, making it easier to turn the bolt.

### 3. **Door Hinges**

A door hinge provides an axis of rotation, and the torque is created by the force applied when opening the door. The force is greatest when applied at the edge of the door, farthest from the hinge.

### 4. **Levers**

Levers are simple machines that use torque to amplify force. By applying a force at a greater distance from the pivot, a small force can lift a large load.

## Summary

- **Moment** and **torque** both measure the ability of a force to cause rotation, but torque is often used to refer to forces causing rotation in mechanical systems.
- An object is in **equilibrium** when there is no net force or net torque acting on it.
- Translational equilibrium requires the sum of all forces to be zero, and rotational equilibrium requires the sum of all torques to be zero.

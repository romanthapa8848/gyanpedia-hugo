# Linear Momentum and Impulse

Linear momentum and impulse are essential concepts in dynamics, helping explain how forces act on objects over time and how motion is influenced by external interactions.

## Linear Momentum

### Definition
Linear momentum ($p$) is the product of an object's mass ($m$) and its velocity ($v$). It is a vector quantity, having both magnitude and direction.

$$
p = mv
$$

### SI Unit
The SI unit of linear momentum is $\text{kg·m/s}$.

### Characteristics
- Linear momentum is conserved in an isolated system (no external forces).
- It follows the direction of the velocity vector.

### Applications
- Collisions (elastic and inelastic).
- Rocket propulsion.

## Impulse

### Definition
Impulse ($J$) is the product of the force ($F$) acting on an object and the time duration ($\Delta t$) during which the force acts. It measures the change in momentum.

$$
J = F \Delta t
$$

### Impulse-Momentum Theorem
The impulse on an object equals the change in its linear momentum:

$$
J = \Delta p = p_{\text{final}} - p_{\text{initial}}
$$

### SI Unit
The SI unit of impulse is $\text{N·s}$, which is equivalent to $\text{kg·m/s}$.

## Examples of Linear Momentum and Impulse in Action

1. **Car Safety Features**:
   - Airbags and seatbelts reduce force by increasing time ($\Delta t$) during a collision, minimizing injury.
2. **Sports**:
   - A bat hitting a ball: Impulse changes the ball's momentum.
3. **Rocket Launch**:
   - Exhaust gases impart momentum to propel the rocket upward.

## Summary

- Linear momentum is a measure of motion, proportional to mass and velocity.
- Impulse quantifies the effect of force over time, leading to a change in momentum.
- The impulse-momentum theorem connects force, time, and momentum change.

## FAQs

**1. What is linear momentum?**  
Linear momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity: $p = mv$.

**2. What is impulse?**  
Impulse is the product of force and the time for which it acts: $J = F \Delta t$.

**3. How are impulse and momentum related?**  
The impulse-momentum theorem states that impulse equals the change in momentum: $J = \Delta p$.

**4. Why is linear momentum a vector quantity?**  
Because it depends on velocity, which has both magnitude and direction.

**5. What are the SI units of momentum and impulse?**  
Both have the unit $\text{kg·m/s}$ or $\text{N·s}$.

**6. How is momentum conserved in collisions?**  
In an isolated system with no external forces, the total momentum before and after the collision remains constant.

**7. Why are airbags important in cars?**  
They increase the time of impact, reducing the force on passengers.

**8. Can a light object have high momentum?**  
Yes, if its velocity is very high (e.g., a bullet).

**9. What is the significance of impulse in sports?**  
Impulse helps explain how force and time affect a ball's motion during hits or kicks.

**10. Is impulse a scalar or vector quantity?**  
Impulse is a vector quantity since it depends on force, which has direction.

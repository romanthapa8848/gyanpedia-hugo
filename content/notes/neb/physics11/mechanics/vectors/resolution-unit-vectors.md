# Resolution of Vectors and Unit Vectors

In physics, vectors represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction. The **resolution of vectors** is the process of breaking a vector into components along different axes. **Unit vectors** are vectors that have a magnitude of one and are used to specify directions in space.

## Resolution of Vectors

The **resolution of a vector** involves splitting it into two or more components along different axes, typically the horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) axes in two-dimensional space. This process simplifies the analysis of vectors by making them easier to work with.

### Components of a Vector

Consider a vector **$\vec{A}$** in two dimensions, making an angle **$\theta$** with the positive x-axis. The components of the vector **$\vec{A}$** along the x and y axes are:

- **$A_x$** (horizontal component) = **$A \cos \theta$**
- **$A_y$** (vertical component) = **$A \sin \theta$**

Thus, the vector **$\vec{A}$** can be written as the sum of its components along the x and y axes:

$$
\vec{A} = A_x \hat{i} + A_y \hat{j}
$$

where **$\hat{i}$** and **$\hat{j}$** are the unit vectors along the x and y axes, respectively.

### Example of Resolution

If a vector **$\vec{A}$** has a magnitude of 10 units and makes an angle of 30° with the x-axis, its components are:

- **$A_x = 10 \cos 30^\circ = 10 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 8.66$**
- **$A_y = 10 \sin 30^\circ = 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = 5$**

Thus, the vector **$\vec{A}$** can be written as:

$$
\vec{A} = 8.66 \hat{i} + 5 \hat{j}
$$

## Unit Vectors

A **unit vector** is a vector that has a magnitude of one and is used to specify the direction of a vector. Unit vectors are denoted by a **hat symbol** (e.g., **$\hat{i}$**, **$\hat{j}$**, **$\hat{k}$**).

### Common Unit Vectors

- **$\hat{i}$**: Unit vector along the x-axis (horizontal direction).
- **$\hat{j}$**: Unit vector along the y-axis (vertical direction).
- **$\hat{k}$**: Unit vector along the z-axis (in three-dimensional space).

These unit vectors are used to express any vector in terms of its components along the x, y, and z axes.

### Representation of a Vector Using Unit Vectors

Any vector **$\vec{A}$** in three dimensions can be written as:

$$
\vec{A} = A_x \hat{i} + A_y \hat{j} + A_z \hat{k}
$$

where **$A_x$**, **$A_y$**, and **$A_z$** are the components of the vector along the x, y, and z axes, respectively.

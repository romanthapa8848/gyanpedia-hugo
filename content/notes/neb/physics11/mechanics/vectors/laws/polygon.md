# Polygon Law of Vectors

The **Polygon Law of Vectors** is another method for adding vectors graphically. It states that if multiple vectors are represented by the sides of a polygon, taken in order, then the resultant vector is represented by the diagonal drawn from the initial point to the final point of the polygon.

## Statement

> If a number of vectors are represented in magnitude and direction by the sides of a polygon taken in order, then the resultant vector is represented by the diagonal of the polygon drawn from the initial point to the final point.

---

## Representation

Consider multiple vectors **$\vec{A_1}$**, **$\vec{A_2}$**, ..., **$\vec{A_n}$**:
1. Represent the vectors **$\vec{A_1}$**, **$\vec{A_2}$**, ..., **$\vec{A_n}$** as directed line segments starting from a common point.
2. The vectors should be drawn in a sequential order, one after the other.
3. The resultant vector **$\vec{R}$** is represented by the diagonal drawn from the initial point to the final point of the polygon.

### Mathematical Representation

- The resultant vector can be calculated by vector addition:
  $$
  \vec{R} = \vec{A_1} + \vec{A_2} + \cdots + \vec{A_n}
  $$  
  where each vector is represented by its magnitude and direction.

## Proof: Polygon Law of Vector Addition

The **Polygon Law of Vector Addition** states that if the sides of a polygon represent multiple vectors in magnitude and direction, then the resultant vector is represented by the diagonal drawn from the initial point to the final point of the polygon.

### Derivation:

Consider a polygon with vectors **$\vec{A}$**, **$\vec{B}$**, **$\vec{C}$**, and **$\vec{D}$**. These vectors represent the sides of the polygon taken in the same order. The resultant vector **$\vec{R}$** can be expressed as:

$$
\vec{R} = \vec{A} + \vec{B} + \vec{C} + \vec{D}
$$

Now, consider a polygon of 5 sides. By applying the **Triangle Law of Vector Addition** to each successive pair of vectors:

1. In triangle **ABC**, by the triangle law, we have:
   $$
   \vec{AB} + \vec{BC} = \vec{AC} \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   $$

2. Similarly:
   $$
   \vec{AC} + \vec{CD} = \vec{AD} \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   $$

3. And:
   $$
   \vec{AD} + \vec{DE} = \vec{AE} \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
   $$

By adding Equations 1, 2, and 3, we get:
$$
\vec{AB} + \vec{BC} + \vec{CD} + \vec{DE} = \vec{AE}
$$

Here, **$\vec{AE}$** is the resultant vector, and the other terms are the individual vectors. This can be extended for an **n-sided polygon** using similar steps.

Thus, the **Polygon Law of Vector Addition** allows the addition of vectors in a polygonal shape, where the diagonal from the initial to the final point gives the resultant vector.

## Applications

### 1. **Force Addition**
   - The Polygon Law is used to find the resultant of multiple forces acting at different angles.

### 2. **Velocity and Displacement**
   - It helps find the net displacement or velocity when multiple components act simultaneously at different directions.

### 3. **Mechanics**
   - This law is often used in mechanics to calculate the net effect of several forces or velocities in various directions.

## Summary

- The Polygon Law of Vectors is used to add multiple vectors graphically.
- The resultant vector is represented by the diagonal of the polygon formed by the vectors.
- This method can be extended to add any number of vectors.

## FAQs

**1. What is the Polygon Law of Vectors?**  
The Polygon Law of Vectors states that if vectors are represented by the sides of a polygon, the diagonal drawn from the initial point to the final point gives the resultant vector.

**2. How is the resultant vector determined using the Polygon Law?**  
The resultant vector is represented by the diagonal of the polygon formed by joining the vectors in sequence.

**3. Can the Polygon Law be used for two vectors?**  
Yes, it is just another graphical method for adding vectors, similar to the Parallelogram Law.

**4. Can the Polygon Law be applied to more than two vectors?**  
Yes, the Polygon Law is particularly useful for adding multiple vectors at once.

**5. How does the Polygon Law differ from the Parallelogram Law?**  
The Parallelogram Law is used for two vectors, while the Polygon Law can be used to add multiple vectors.

**6. What happens when the vectors form a closed polygon?**  
If the vectors form a closed polygon (i.e., the initial and final points coincide), the resultant vector is zero.

**7. Can the Polygon Law be used to subtract vectors?**  
Yes, vector subtraction can be done by reversing the direction of one vector and then applying the Polygon Law.

**8. How does the angle between vectors affect the resultant?**  
The angle between the vectors determines the direction and magnitude of the resultant vector.

**9. What is the significance of the order in which the vectors are added?**  
The order in which the vectors are connected affects the direction of the resultant but not its magnitude.

**10. What is the main use of the Polygon Law in physics?**  
It is mainly used to determine the resultant of multiple forces or velocities acting at different angles.

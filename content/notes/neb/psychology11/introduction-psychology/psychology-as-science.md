# What is Science and How Psychology is a Science

### What is Science?  
Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. It is based on empirical methods—such as observation, experimentation, and analysis—and relies on objectivity and critical evaluation to uncover truths about the natural world. Science seeks to understand the principles of natural phenomena and is always open to revision in light of new evidence.

### How is Psychology a Science?  
Psychology is considered a science because it uses scientific methods to study human behavior and mental processes. Unlike philosophy, which relies on reasoning and logic, psychology applies empirical approaches to explore the mind and behavior. Psychologists conduct controlled experiments, collect and analyze data, and use evidence-based methods to explain psychological phenomena. The establishment of psychology as a science began in 1879 with Wilhelm Wundt’s founding of the first experimental laboratory, marking its shift from philosophy to a scientific discipline.

# Contribution of Greek Philosophy: Socrates, Aristotle, Plato

Greek philosophers made significant contributions to the evolution of psychology by exploring questions about the mind, behavior, and the nature of human existence. Their philosophical ideas provided the foundation for later psychological theories and practices.

### **Socrates (469–399 BCE)**  
- Advocated for introspection and self-awareness, famously stating, "Know thyself."
- Used the **Socratic Method**, which involves asking probing questions to encourage critical thinking and uncover deeper truths.
- Emphasized ethical reasoning and the pursuit of virtue, forming the basis for understanding moral and cognitive development.

### **Plato (427–347 BCE)**  
- A student of Socrates, Plato introduced the concept of **dualism**, distinguishing between the body and soul. He viewed the soul as the true essence of an individual.  
- Proposed the **tripartite model of the soul**:  
  1. **Rational** - Governs reasoning and logic.  
  2. **Spirited** - Relates to emotions and willpower.  
  3. **Appetitive** - Concerned with desires and physical needs.  
- Believed in **innate knowledge**, suggesting that learning is the recollection of eternal truths.  

### **Aristotle (384–322 BCE)**  
- A student of Plato, Aristotle rejected dualism and emphasized empirical observation, integrating philosophy with natural sciences.  
- Authored *De Anima* (*On the Soul*), one of the earliest works on psychological concepts.  
- Viewed the mind as a **blank slate** (*tabula rasa*), emphasizing the role of experience in shaping knowledge.  
- Proposed a **holistic view** of the body and soul, arguing they are inseparable and interdependent.

These philosophers not only explored the nature of the mind and behavior but also laid the groundwork for systematic thinking in psychology.

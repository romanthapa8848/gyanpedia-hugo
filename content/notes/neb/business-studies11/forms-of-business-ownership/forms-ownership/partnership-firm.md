# Partnership Firm

A **partnership firm** is a business arrangement where two or more individuals come together to carry on a business and share profits and losses. It is one of the most common forms of business organization, especially in small to medium-sized enterprises. In Nepal, the formation and regulation of partnership firms are governed by the **Partnership Act, 1964**.

## Features of a Partnership Firm

### 1. **Mutual Agreement**

A partnership firm is based on a mutual agreement between the partners, which may be written or oral. The agreement outlines the terms of the partnership, such as profit-sharing, responsibilities, and management duties.

### 2. **Shared Profits and Losses**

Partners share the profits and losses of the business according to the agreed-upon ratio. This distribution is usually based on the capital contribution, but partners can also agree to a different ratio.

### 3. **Unlimited Liability**

In a general partnership, partners have **unlimited liability**, meaning they are personally responsible for the business's debts and obligations. This can put their personal assets at risk in case of business failure.

### 4. **Collective Decision-Making**

Decisions in a partnership firm are typically made collectively by the partners. Each partner has a say in the management of the business, depending on the partnership agreement.

### 5. **Legal Entity**

A partnership firm is not a separate legal entity from its owners. This means that the business cannot sue or be sued in its own name. The partners are individually and jointly responsible for the firm’s obligations.

### 6. **Flexibility**

Partnerships are relatively flexible compared to other business forms like corporations. They can be easily set up, and the terms of the partnership can be tailored to meet the needs of the partners.

## Types of Partnership Firms

### 1. **General Partnership**

In a general partnership, all partners share equal responsibility for managing the business and are equally liable for its debts.

### 2. **Limited Partnership (LP)**

A limited partnership consists of at least one general partner who manages the business and one or more limited partners who invest capital but do not take part in the daily operations of the business. Limited partners' liability is limited to the amount they have invested.

### 3. **Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)**

A limited liability partnership is a hybrid form of business where partners have limited liability. It combines the flexibility of a partnership with the limited liability feature of a corporation.

## Summary

# Registration Process of a Company in Nepal

Starting a business in Nepal requires going through a formal registration process. The **Company Registration** process involves legal procedures that ensure a business is recognized by the government and complies with the **Companies Act, 2006** of Nepal. The following outlines the step-by-step process for registering a company in Nepal.

## 1. **Choose a Company Name**

Before beginning the registration process, the first step is to select a suitable name for the company. The name should reflect the nature of the business and must be unique. It should not be similar to any existing company or trade name.

### Requirements for the Company Name:

- The name must be in compliance with the **Company Registration Act**.
- It must not violate trademarks or other intellectual property laws.
- The name should be easy to remember and not misleading.

## 2. **Prepare Required Documents**

The next step is to gather the necessary documents that are required for company registration. The following documents are typically needed:

- **Company’s Memorandum of Association (MoA)**
- **Company’s Articles of Association (AoA)**
- **Proof of identity and address of directors** (e.g., passport copy or citizenship card)
- **Residence certificate of directors**
- **Passport-sized photos of directors**
- **No Objection Certificate (NOC)** from the landlord if the office is rented
- **Copy of PAN card** of the company (for tax purposes)

## 3. **Obtain Name Approval**

Once the company name has been selected, the next step is to get approval for the company name from the **Office of the Company Registrar (OCR)**. This process involves submitting the proposed name to the OCR for review. If the name is unique and complies with legal requirements, approval will be granted.

### Steps for Name Approval:

- Submit the **Application for Name Reservation** to the OCR.
- Pay the prescribed **fees** for name reservation.
- Wait for confirmation of approval.

## 4. **Submit Documents to the Company Registrar**

### Submission Process:

### Certificate of Incorporation:

- It contains the **company registration number** and **date of incorporation**.
- The company is now officially recognized as a legal entity.

## 6. **Register for Taxes and Obtain PAN**

The PAN is essential for conducting any financial transactions and filing taxes. Additionally, the company must register for **VAT (Value Added Tax)** if its annual turnover exceeds the specified threshold.

### Tax Registration Process:

- Provide required documents such as **company registration certificate**, **MoA**, **AoA**, and **proof of office address**.

### Required Documents for Bank Account:

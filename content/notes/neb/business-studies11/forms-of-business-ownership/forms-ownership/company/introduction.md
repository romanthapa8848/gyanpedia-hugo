# Introduction to Public and Private Company

In Nepal, companies are mainly classified into **Public Limited Companies** and **Private Limited Companies**, both of which are governed by the **Companies Act, 2006**. Although both types share some common features, such as being separate legal entities, they differ in various ways, including their structure, ownership, and capacity to raise capital. Understanding these differences is crucial for entrepreneurs, investors, and legal professionals when deciding the type of company that best suits their needs.

## Public Company

A **Public Limited Company** is a company whose shares are available for purchase by the general public, typically through a stock exchange. These companies are subject to stricter regulations and have a larger number of shareholders. Public companies are typically larger in scale and have more significant capital needs.

### Key Features of Public Companies:

- **Shareholders**: A minimum of **7 shareholders** is required, and there is no maximum limit.
- **Shares**: Shares are freely transferable and can be bought or sold on the stock market.
- **Formation**: Requires approval from the government and regulatory bodies to ensure transparency.
- **Capital Raising**: Can raise capital through public offerings of shares and debentures.
- **Management**: Managed by a board of directors elected by shareholders.
- **Transparency**: Public companies are required to disclose financial information regularly.

## Private Company

A **Private Limited Company** is a company with a limited number of shareholders, and its shares cannot be offered to the general public. Private companies are generally smaller in size and are typically not listed on stock exchanges. These companies provide more control to the owners and are subject to fewer regulations compared to public companies.

### Key Features of Private Companies:

- **Shareholders**: A minimum of **2 shareholders** and a maximum of **50 shareholders**.
- **Shares**: Shares cannot be offered to the public or traded freely.
- **Formation**: Easier and less costly to form compared to public companies.
- **Capital Raising**: Can raise capital through private placements or loans, but not through public offerings.
- **Management**: Managed by a board of directors, but more flexibility in decision-making.
- **Privacy**: Fewer disclosure requirements compared to public companies.

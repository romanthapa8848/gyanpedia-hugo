# Features of Company Business

A company is a distinct legal entity, which means it has its own rights and responsibilities separate from its owners (shareholders). In Nepal, the **Companies Act, 2006** governs the formation, operation, and dissolution of companies. Companies are a popular form of business structure due to their ability to limit liability and raise capital. Below are the key features of company businesses:

## 1. **Separate Legal Entity**

One of the primary features of a company is that it is considered a **separate legal entity**. This means that the company is distinct from its shareholders or directors. It can own property, enter into contracts, sue, and be sued in its own name. The shareholders' personal assets are protected, as they are not liable for the company's debts beyond the value of their shares.

## 2. **Limited Liability**

In a company, the liability of shareholders is generally **limited** to the amount they have invested or the unpaid portion of their shares. This provides protection to the shareholders, ensuring that their personal assets are not at risk in the event of the company's failure or bankruptcy.

## 3. **Perpetual Succession**

A company has **perpetual succession**, meaning its existence is not affected by changes in its ownership or management. It continues to operate until it is formally dissolved, even if shareholders or directors change, or shareholders sell their shares.

## 4. **Transferability of Shares**

The shares of a company can generally be transferred from one shareholder to another. This is particularly true for **public companies**, where shares are traded on stock exchanges. In **private companies**, while share transfer is allowed, it is usually subject to certain restrictions (such as approval by other shareholders).

## 5. **Centralized Management**

Companies are managed by a **board of directors**, elected by the shareholders. The board is responsible for making major decisions regarding the company’s operations, strategy, and policies. Day-to-day management may be delegated to a management team or executives, but the directors retain the ultimate decision-making power.

## 6. **Raising Capital**

A company has several options to raise capital, which include issuing **shares**, **debentures**, or securing loans. **Public companies** can raise capital by offering shares to the general public through stock exchanges, while **private companies** generally raise capital from a limited number of investors or by taking out loans.

## 7. **Distinct Ownership and Control**

In a company, ownership and control are separate. The shareholders own the company through their shares, while the **management** of the company is carried out by the directors or executives. This separation allows for a professional management structure, especially in large companies.

## 8. **Regulatory Requirements**

Companies are subject to stringent **regulatory requirements** imposed by the government, including the submission of annual financial statements, tax returns, and compliance with labor and environmental laws. Public companies face more regulations than private companies, especially in terms of financial disclosures and shareholder rights.

## 9. **Taxation**

Companies are generally taxed separately from their owners. They pay taxes on their profits, and shareholders are taxed again on any dividends or capital gains they receive. The **taxation structure** may differ based on the type of company, its location, and the nature of its business activities.

## 10. **Separate Management from Ownership**

In a company, the **shareholders** typically do not get involved in the day-to-day management of the company. This separation allows the company to be run by professional managers and directors who have the expertise to make informed decisions and run the business efficiently.

## Summary

The key features of a company business include its **separate legal entity**, **limited liability**, and **perpetual succession**. Companies offer a flexible structure for business operations, allowing them to raise capital, transfer ownership, and operate with a centralized management team. Due to their size, complexity, and regulatory requirements, companies are often more suited for large-scale businesses that require significant capital and have multiple stakeholders.

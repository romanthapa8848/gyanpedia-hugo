# Modes of Dissolution of Partnership Firm in Nepal

Dissolution of a partnership firm refers to the process of ending the legal existence of the firm. A partnership firm may dissolve voluntarily or involuntarily, depending on various circumstances. In Nepal, the dissolution of a partnership is governed by the **Partnership Act, 1997** and the **partnership deed** between the partners. This section outlines the different modes of dissolution and the legal processes involved in each.

## Modes of Dissolution

### 1. **Dissolution by Agreement**

One of the simplest and most common methods of dissolving a partnership firm is through mutual agreement among all partners. If all the partners agree to end the partnership, the firm is dissolved in accordance with the terms set out in the **partnership deed**.

#### Procedure:

- All partners must agree in writing.
- A **dissolution deed** is prepared and signed.
- The firm’s assets are liquidated and liabilities are settled.
- A public notice may be published to inform creditors and the public about the dissolution.

### 2. **Dissolution by Notice**

In a partnership firm, if the partnership is at will (i.e., no fixed term has been specified), any partner can dissolve the firm by giving **notice** to the other partners.

#### Procedure:

- One partner issues a **written notice of dissolution** to the other partners.
- The notice must specify the date of dissolution.
- The firm’s assets are liquidated, and liabilities are paid off.

### 3. **Dissolution by Court Order**

A partnership can be dissolved by a court order under certain circumstances, such as when a partner is declared **insane**, **incapacitated**, or involved in illegal activities. The court may also order dissolution if there is a conflict between partners that prevents the firm from operating effectively.

#### Procedure:

- A petition for dissolution is filed with the **court** by any partner.
- The court examines the case and issues a judgment for dissolution.
- The court-appointed receiver or liquidator oversees the settlement of the firm’s assets and liabilities.

### 4. **Dissolution due to Expiry of Term**

If the partnership agreement specifies a fixed term for the business, the partnership firm is automatically dissolved upon the expiration of that term.

#### Procedure:

- The partnership agreement should clearly specify the term duration.
- Upon the expiry date, the partnership automatically ceases to exist.
- If any partner wishes to continue, a new partnership agreement must be drafted.

### 5. **Dissolution by Bankruptcy or Insolvency**

A partnership firm can also be dissolved if it faces **bankruptcy** or **insolvency**. If the firm is unable to pay its debts and liabilities, a partner or creditor may initiate bankruptcy proceedings, leading to dissolution.

#### Procedure:

- A partner or creditor files for bankruptcy with the relevant authorities.
- The court may appoint a liquidator to sell the firm’s assets and pay off liabilities.
- Once the liabilities are settled, the partnership is dissolved.

### 6. **Dissolution by Death or Retirement of a Partner**

The death or retirement of a partner may result in the dissolution of the partnership unless there is a **continuation clause** in the partnership deed. If a partner dies or retires, the firm may either continue with the remaining partners or dissolve based on the agreement.

#### Procedure:

- If the deed allows for continuation after a partner’s death, the remaining partners may decide to continue.
- If there is no such clause, the partnership is dissolved.
- The assets and liabilities are divided among the partners or their heirs.

### 7. **Compulsory Dissolution**

Compulsory dissolution occurs when the firm is dissolved due to a legal reason, such as the firm carrying out illegal activities or being involved in fraud. The court may order the dissolution if the business operates against public policy.

#### Procedure:

- The concerned authority (such as the court or government body) issues a dissolution order.
- The assets are liquidated, and the firm is dissolved according to the ruling.

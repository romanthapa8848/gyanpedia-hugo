# History, Emergence of Psychosocial Counseling in Nepal

The history of psychosocial counseling in Nepal is relatively recent but has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Traditionally, Nepalese society has had limited access to formal mental health services, and psychosocial issues were often dealt with through informal community and family-based support systems. However, the increasing recognition of mental health as a critical aspect of overall well-being has led to the establishment and expansion of psychosocial counseling services in the country.

The first formal psychosocial counseling services in Nepal were introduced in the early 1990s, primarily in urban centers such as Kathmandu. With the growing awareness of mental health issues and the importance of psychological support, various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international agencies began offering training programs for counselors and promoting psychosocial services. These services focused on addressing trauma, stress, and emotional challenges resulting from political conflicts, natural disasters, and other socio-economic factors.

Over time, the government of Nepal has also started to recognize the importance of mental health and psychosocial support. The establishment of mental health policies and programs, particularly in response to the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake, led to the greater integration of psychosocial counseling into national health services. Today, psychosocial counseling is provided in many government and private hospitals, as well as community-based organizations, to help individuals cope with stress, mental health issues, and social challenges.

# Multilayered Supports in an Emergency: Basic Services and Security, Community and Family Supports, Focused Non-specialized Supports, Specialized Services

In emergency situations, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) is crucial for helping individuals recover from the trauma and stress caused by crises. The **Intervention Pyramid for MHPSS** outlines a structured, multilayered approach to support individuals at different levels, starting from basic services and security to specialized services. Each layer addresses different levels of needs, ensuring that everyone affected by the emergency receives appropriate support.

---

## 1. Basic Services and Security
- **Essentials for Survival**: The first and most critical layer focuses on ensuring that basic needs are met, such as food, water, shelter, and safety. Security is crucial to prevent further harm and provide a sense of stability.
- **Protection from Harm**: Ensuring the safety of individuals, particularly vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Emergency responders must ensure that the affected population is protected from exploitation, violence, and abuse.
- **Crisis Stabilization**: At this stage, immediate support is offered to stabilize individuals emotionally and physically. This might include providing first aid or guiding people to safe places.
- **Human Rights and Dignity**: Ensuring that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or the severity of their distress. Upholding human rights in the emergency setting is crucial for the overall recovery process.

## 2. Community and Family Supports
- **Social Networks**: The second layer emphasizes the importance of community and family support systems. In times of crisis, individuals often turn to their families and communities for comfort, reassurance, and practical help.
- **Promoting Social Cohesion**: Strengthening community networks to help individuals and families feel supported. This can involve mobilizing community leaders, local organizations, and peer groups to provide comfort and practical support.
- **Family Support**: Families are often the first responders to distress. Involving them in the care process and educating them about coping mechanisms and emotional support is essential.
- **Mutual Aid**: Encouraging individuals to help one another by sharing resources and emotional support. This mutual aid can significantly strengthen the resilience of the community during emergencies.

---

## 3. Focused Non-specialized Supports
- **Supportive Listening**: The third level focuses on providing more targeted support for individuals who need help but do not require specialized psychological interventions. This can include active listening, validating experiences, and offering emotional reassurance.
- **Psychoeducation**: Providing individuals with practical knowledge about coping strategies, stress management, and self-care to help them navigate the immediate aftermath of a crisis.
- **Community-based Counseling**: In some cases, non-specialized counselors or trained volunteers can provide individual or group counseling sessions to address common mental health challenges such as anxiety, grief, and stress.
- **Psychosocial Activities**: Organizing activities that promote well-being, such as group exercises, art therapy, and relaxation techniques, to help individuals reconnect and cope with the distressing effects of the crisis.

---

## 4. Specialized Services
- **Mental Health Professionals**: At the top of the intervention pyramid are specialized services, which are reserved for individuals who need professional psychological or psychiatric care due to severe trauma, mental health disorders, or long-term distress.
- **Psychiatric Support**: This may include medication management for individuals with psychiatric conditions, as well as ongoing therapy and treatment for more complex mental health issues.
- **Individual Therapy**: Specialized therapeutic interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), trauma-focused therapy, or other evidence-based therapeutic modalities tailored to the needs of the individual.
- **Medical and Psychiatric Clinics**: Establishing clinics or mobile units to provide psychiatric care and medication for those with severe mental health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or psychosis.
- **Referral Systems**: Effective referral systems are essential to ensure that individuals who need specialized care are directed to appropriate healthcare facilities and professionals.

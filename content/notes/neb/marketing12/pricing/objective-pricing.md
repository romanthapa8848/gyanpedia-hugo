# Objective of Pricing: Profit-oriented, Sales-oriented, and Status Quo Objective

Pricing is a critical aspect of marketing, and businesses set their prices with different objectives in mind. The objective of pricing varies depending on the company’s goals, market conditions, and the product or service being sold. In general, there are three main types of pricing objectives: **profit-oriented**, **sales-oriented**, and **status quo**.

## 1. Profit-oriented Objective

The **profit-oriented objective** focuses on maximizing the company’s profits. The goal is to set a price that will generate the highest possible profit margin for the company, considering the costs of production, marketing, and distribution. Profit-oriented pricing can take several forms:

- **Target Profit Pricing**: Setting a specific profit target for a product or service.
- **Maximizing Profits**: Setting a price that will yield the highest possible profit, often through price optimization models.

This pricing strategy is commonly used by businesses that want to ensure financial growth and long-term sustainability.

## 2. Sales-oriented Objective

The **sales-oriented objective** focuses on increasing the volume of sales rather than maximizing profit per unit. Companies using this approach may lower their prices to attract more customers and capture a larger market share. The sales-oriented objective is common in the following scenarios:

- **Market Penetration**: Setting low prices to gain market share quickly.
- **Sales Growth**: Focusing on increasing the number of units sold even at the expense of profit margins.

Sales-oriented pricing is typically used when the business is looking to establish itself in a competitive market or increase its market share.

## 3. Status Quo Objective

The **status quo objective** focuses on maintaining stable prices in comparison with competitors. This strategy involves setting prices to match or stay close to the existing price levels in the market. The key goal is to avoid price wars and maintain market stability.

- **Price Matching**: Matching competitor prices to maintain competitive parity.
- **Stability**: Maintaining consistent prices to avoid volatility in the market.

This approach is often used by businesses that operate in highly competitive or mature markets where differentiation is difficult, and they want to maintain a stable customer base.

# Meaning and Definition of Price and Pricing

## Meaning of Price

**Price** is the amount of money a consumer is willing to pay for a product or service. It represents the value exchanged between the buyer and the seller for the ownership or use of a product. In marketing, price is one of the most critical elements of the marketing mix, as it directly affects consumer purchasing decisions, the perception of product value, and the profitability of a business.

Price is not just the monetary value but also reflects the perceived worth of a product in the market. It is determined by various factors such as production costs, competition, market demand, and consumer behavior.

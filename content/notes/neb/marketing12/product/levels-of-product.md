# Levels of Product

## Introduction

In marketing, the concept of **levels of product** refers to the different stages or components that make up a product offering. Each level adds more value to the product and helps in differentiating it from competitors. Marketers must understand these levels to create products that fulfill customer needs and stand out in the market.

## Levels of Product

There are three primary levels of a product:

1. **Core Product**
2. **Actual Product**
3. **Augmented Product**

These levels represent the different layers of a product offering that collectively provide value to the customer.

### 1. Core Product

The **core product** is the basic need or benefit that the product is designed to satisfy. It is the fundamental reason why a consumer buys a product, and it represents the underlying benefit or problem-solving feature.

#### Key Points:

- It addresses the basic need or desire of the consumer.
- For example, the core product of a **smartphone** is communication, or for a **hotel room**, it is accommodation.

#### Example:

- For a **car**, the core product is transportation.
- For **education services**, the core product is knowledge.

### 2. Actual Product

The **actual product** is the tangible item or service that offers the core benefit. This level represents the product’s features, design, packaging, branding, and quality. It is the product that consumers physically purchase.

#### Key Points:

- The actual product has physical attributes like design, features, branding, and packaging.
- It is what customers perceive and experience.

#### Example:

- For a **smartphone**, the actual product includes its design, operating system, screen size, camera quality, and brand name.
- For **a pair of shoes**, the actual product includes the design, material, size, and color.

### 3. Augmented Product

The **augmented product** includes additional services or features that enhance the value of the product beyond the basic and actual product. This level is what differentiates the product in the market and adds extra benefits to the customer.

#### Key Points:

- The augmented product can include after-sales service, warranties, delivery options, customer support, or any other extra features.
- It helps build customer loyalty and can be a competitive advantage.

#### Example:

- For a **smartphone**, augmented products include warranty, software updates, and customer support services.

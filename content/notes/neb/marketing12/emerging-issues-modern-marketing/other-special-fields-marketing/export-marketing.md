It involves a variety of strategies and activities to ensure that products meet the needs of customers in other countries and comply with international standards and regulations. The goal of export marketing is to expand the market reach of a business, increase sales, and enhance profitability by tapping into global demand.

### Meaning of Export Marketing

Export marketing is the marketing of goods and services to foreign countries. It involves identifying foreign markets, understanding their demand for specific products, and finding the most effective methods of entering and competing in those markets. Export marketing is essential for businesses looking to grow internationally and increase their revenue streams.

### Features of Export Marketing

2. **Product Adaptation**: Products may need to be modified to suit the tastes, preferences, and legal requirements of the target market. This could involve packaging changes, alterations in product features, or compliance with local regulations.
3. **Pricing Strategy**: Pricing strategies should account for local economic conditions, competitor pricing, tariffs, and currency fluctuations. Competitive pricing is key to attracting foreign customers.
4. **Promotion and Advertising**: Promotion in export marketing often requires the use of international media, trade shows, and digital marketing to reach global audiences. The promotional message must be tailored to the cultural norms and values of the target market.

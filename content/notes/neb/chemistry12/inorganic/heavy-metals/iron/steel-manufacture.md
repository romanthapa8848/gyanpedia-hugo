# Manufacture of Steel by Basic Oxygen Method and Open Hearth Process

Steel is one of the most important materials used in industries worldwide, and its production process involves converting raw materials like pig iron into steel with the desired properties. The two common methods for steel manufacturing are the **Basic Oxygen Method** and the **Open Hearth Process**. Let's explore these methods in detail.

## 1. Basic Oxygen Method

The **Basic Oxygen Method** (BOS) is the most widely used method for producing steel today. It involves blowing oxygen through molten pig iron in a converter, which results in the oxidation of impurities like carbon, silicon, and sulfur. The oxygen reacts with these impurities, forming gases that are removed from the metal. The process is efficient, producing high-quality steel in a relatively short time.

### A. **Reaction and Process**

- In the basic oxygen process, oxygen is blown into the molten iron, which causes the carbon content to decrease and form carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO_2}$) or carbon monoxide ($\ce{CO}$). The impurities are oxidized and removed as gases.

The main reactions that occur are:
$$ \ce{Fe} + \ce{O2} \rightarrow \ce{FeO} $$

$$ \ce{FeO} + \ce{C} \rightarrow \ce{Fe} + \ce{CO} $$

Other impurities like silicon and sulfur are also removed:
$$ \ce{Si} + \ce{O2} \rightarrow \ce{SiO2} $$

$$ \ce{S} + \ce{O2} \rightarrow \ce{SO2} $$

- The **Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF)** typically operates at a temperature of around **1650°C**. The oxygen supply is controlled to ensure that the oxidation of impurities is maximized while minimizing the loss of iron.

### B. **Advantages of the Basic Oxygen Method**

- **Speed**: This method is much faster compared to other methods like the Open Hearth Process. Steel can be produced in approximately 30 minutes.
- **Efficiency**: It uses fewer raw materials and energy, making it more cost-effective.
- **High-quality steel**: The process provides high-purity steel with a controlled carbon content.

## 2. Open Hearth Process

The **Open Hearth Process** was a commonly used method for steel production before the Basic Oxygen Method became more popular. In this process, the molten iron from a blast furnace is mixed with scrap iron in a large, shallow furnace known as the **hearth**. Heat is generated by burning a mixture of coke and limestone, and the process lasts several hours, allowing for the desired chemical composition of steel.

### A. **Reaction and Process**

In the Open Hearth Process, the molten iron undergoes oxidation and reduction reactions. Some of the main reactions that occur are:

- Oxidation of carbon:
  $$ \ce{C + O2} \rightarrow \ce{CO2} $$

- Reduction of iron oxides:
  $$ \ce{FeO} + \ce{C} \rightarrow \ce{Fe} + \ce{CO} $$

- Removal of sulfur:
  $$ \ce{CaO} + \ce{SO2} \rightarrow \ce{CaSO3} $$

The primary reactions result in the desired reduction of carbon content and other impurities from the pig iron, making it into steel. The process takes longer than the Basic Oxygen Method, typically lasting about 6-8 hours.

### B. **Advantages and Disadvantages of Open Hearth Process**

- **Advantages**:
  - It can handle large quantities of iron and scrap, making it suitable for large-scale production.
  - It can produce steel with varied compositions, depending on the raw materials used.
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Time-consuming**: The process takes longer than the Basic Oxygen Method.
  - **Energy-intensive**: It requires more energy and raw materials, making it less cost-effective.
  - **Lower efficiency**: The process is not as efficient in terms of material use and energy consumption as modern methods.

## Summary

The **Basic Oxygen Method** is the most modern and efficient method for producing steel, offering speed, energy efficiency, and high-quality steel production. In contrast, the **Open Hearth Process**, though once popular, is slower, more energy-intensive, and less efficient. However, it is still used in some older plants and can produce steel with varying compositions depending on the raw materials used.

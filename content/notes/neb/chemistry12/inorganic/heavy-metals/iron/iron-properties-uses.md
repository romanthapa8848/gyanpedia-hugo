## 1. Properties of Iron

### A. **Physical Properties**

- **Density**: Iron has a relatively high density of **7.87 g/cm³**.
- **Color**: Freshly cut iron has a **silvery-grey** color.
- **Melting Point**: Iron has a high melting point of **1538°C**.
- **Magnetic Properties**: Iron is **ferromagnetic**, meaning it can be magnetized.
- **Malleability**: Iron is malleable and can be hammered into thin sheets without breaking.
- **Ductility**: Iron can be drawn into wires, making it ductile.

### B. **Chemical Properties**

- **Oxidation**: Iron reacts with oxygen in the air to form **iron oxide (rust)**, especially in the presence of moisture.
  $$ 4\ce{Fe} + 3\ce{O2} + 6\ce{H2O} \rightarrow 4\ce{Fe(OH)3} $$

- **Reaction with Acids**: Iron reacts with dilute acids like hydrochloric acid ($\ce{HCl}$) to form iron salts and hydrogen gas.
  $$ \ce{Fe} + 2\ce{HCl} \rightarrow \ce{FeCl2} + \ce{H2} $$

- **Reaction with Bases**: Iron reacts with bases, such as sodium hydroxide ($\ce{NaOH}$), to form hydrogen gas and iron hydroxides.
  $$ \ce{Fe} + 2\ce{NaOH} + 2\ce{H2O} \rightarrow 2\ce{Na[Fe(OH)2]} $$

- **Reaction with Water**: Iron does not react significantly with cold water but reacts slowly with steam to produce iron oxide and hydrogen gas.
  $$ \ce{Fe} + \ce{H2O} \rightarrow \ce{Fe3O4} + \ce{H2} $$

- **Alloy Formation**: Iron is widely used in alloys, such as **steel** (with carbon) and **cast iron** (with high carbon content).

# Occurrence and Extraction of Zinc from Zinc Blende

Zinc is an important metal used in various industrial applications, particularly in galvanization, batteries, and alloys. It occurs primarily in the form of zinc blende, also known as sphalerite, which is its most common ore. Zinc is typically extracted from zinc blende through a series of chemical reactions and processes in a smelting process.

## Occurrence of Zinc

Zinc is found in nature mainly as **zinc blende** (also called **sphalerite**), which is a zinc sulfide mineral, with the chemical formula **$\ce{ZnS}$**. Zinc also occurs in other minerals like calamine (**$\ce{ZnCO_3}$**) and franklinite, but zinc blende is the most important ore for zinc extraction.

### Other Sources of Zinc
- **Calamine (Zinc Carbonate)**: **$\ce{ZnCO_3}$**
- **Zincite**: **$\ce{ZnO}$**
- **Franklinite**: **$\ce{(ZnFe)O_4}$**

## Extraction of Zinc from Zinc Blende

The extraction of zinc from zinc blende involves two main stages: **concentration of the ore** and **reduction of zinc oxide**.

### 1. Concentration of Zinc Blende
The first step in the extraction of zinc is the concentration of the ore. This is typically achieved by **froth flotation**, where zinc blende is mixed with water, and air is blown into the mixture to form a froth. The zinc ore particles attach to the froth and rise to the surface, while the impurities settle at the bottom.

### 2. Roasting of Zinc Blende
After concentration, the zinc blende ore is heated in the presence of excess oxygen (air) in a process called **roasting**. This step converts the zinc sulfide ($\ce{ZnS}$) into zinc oxide ($\ce{ZnO}$). The chemical reaction involved is:

$$\ce{2ZnS + 3O_2 -> 2ZnO + 2SO_2}$$

In this process, sulfur dioxide ($\ce{SO_2}$) is released as a byproduct, which can be used for the production of sulfuric acid.

### 3. Reduction of Zinc Oxide
The next step is the reduction of zinc oxide ($\ce{ZnO}$) to zinc metal. This is achieved by heating zinc oxide with carbon (in the form of coke) in a **blast furnace** or a **reduction furnace**. The carbon reacts with the zinc oxide to produce zinc metal and carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO_2}$):

$$\ce{ZnO + C -> Zn + CO_2}$$

The zinc vapor produced in this reaction is then condensed into solid zinc.

### 4. Purification of Zinc
The zinc obtained from the reduction process is impure and contains several other metals. To purify the zinc, an electrolytic process is used. In this process, impure zinc is used as the anode in an electrolytic cell, with pure zinc as the cathode. The zinc ions are reduced at the cathode, and pure zinc metal is deposited.

## Summary

- **Zinc blende (sphalerite)** is the most common ore of zinc, consisting of zinc sulfide (**$\ce{ZnS}$**).
- The extraction process involves **concentration** by froth flotation, followed by **roasting** to convert **$\ce{ZnS}$** to **$\ce{ZnO}$**.
- The final extraction is done by **reducing zinc oxide** with carbon to obtain **zinc metal**.
- The zinc obtained is purified through an **electrolytic refining process**.

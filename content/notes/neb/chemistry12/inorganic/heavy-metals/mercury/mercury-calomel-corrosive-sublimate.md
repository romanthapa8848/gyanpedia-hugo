# Chemistry of Calomel and Corrosive Sublimate

Both **calomel** and **corrosive sublimate** are important compounds of mercury that have distinctive properties, preparation methods, and uses in different fields, including medicine and industrial applications.

---

## 1. Calomel (Mercurous Chloride) - $\ce{Hg2Cl2}$

### Preparation of Calomel

Calomel is prepared by the following method:
- When mercury reacts with chlorine gas ($\ce{Cl2}$) in the presence of water, calomel is formed:
  $$
  \ce{Hg (l) + Cl2 (g) -> Hg2Cl2 (s)}
  $$

Alternatively, it can be prepared by heating mercury with mercuric chloride ($\ce{HgCl2}$) in the presence of a reducing agent like hydrogen chloride.

### Properties of Calomel

1. **Appearance**: Calomel is a **white, crystalline solid**.
2. **Solubility**: It is **insoluble** in water but soluble in hot alkaline solutions.
3. **Stability**: Calomel is stable in dry air, but when exposed to moisture, it can slowly transform into mercuric chloride.
4. **Electrolyte Property**: Calomel is commonly used in mercury-based electrodes due to its ability to conduct electricity when in contact with mercury.

### Uses of Calomel

1. **Medicine**: Calomel was historically used as a laxative and to treat various diseases like syphilis, but its use has been reduced due to its toxicity.
2. **Electrodes**: It is used in **calomel electrodes** in electrochemical applications.
3. **Photography**: Calomel was used in photographic processes as a sensitizer.
4. **Laboratory Reagent**: It is used in analytical chemistry to prepare mercury salts.

## 2. Corrosive Sublimate (Mercuric Chloride) - $\ce{HgCl2}$

### Preparation of Corrosive Sublimate

Corrosive sublimate is prepared by the direct reaction of mercury with chlorine gas:
$$
\ce{Hg (l) + Cl2 (g) -> HgCl2 (s)}
$$
Alternatively, it can be synthesized by dissolving mercury in hydrochloric acid and oxidizing it with chlorine.

### Properties of Corrosive Sublimate

1. **Appearance**: Corrosive sublimate is a **white, crystalline solid**.
2. **Solubility**: It is **soluble** in water, alcohol, and ether.
3. **Toxicity**: Mercuric chloride is extremely toxic and corrosive, and should be handled with extreme care.
4. **Reactivity**: Corrosive sublimate reacts with reducing agents to form metallic mercury.

### Uses of Corrosive Sublimate

1. **Disinfectant**: Due to its toxic properties, corrosive sublimate is used as a disinfectant and antiseptic.
2. **Preservative**: It has been used as a preservative for biological specimens.
3. **Agriculture**: Mercuric chloride is used as a **fungicide** and **pesticide**.
4. **Photography**: It was used in photographic processing to make paper sensitive to light.

## Summary

Calomel ($\ce{Hg2Cl2}$) and corrosive sublimate ($\ce{HgCl2}$) are both important compounds of mercury with distinct properties and uses. Calomel is less soluble and less toxic than mercuric chloride, which is highly toxic and corrosive. While calomel is used in electrochemical applications and photography, corrosive sublimate is mainly used as a disinfectant, preservative, and in agriculture.

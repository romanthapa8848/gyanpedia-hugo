# Properties and Uses of Mercury

**Mercury** (Hg) is a unique metallic element notable for being a liquid at room temperature. It has distinctive properties that make it useful in various applications but also highly toxic and environmentally hazardous.

## Physical Properties of Mercury

1. **Appearance**: Mercury is a **silver-white, metallic liquid** at room temperature with a high luster.
2. **Density**: Mercury has a very high density of approximately $13.6 \ \text{g/cm}^3$, which is about 13.6 times that of water.
3. **Melting and Boiling Points**: It has a low melting point of $-38.83^\circ \text{C}$ and a boiling point of $356.73^\circ \text{C}$.
4. **Surface Tension**: Mercury has a high surface tension, causing it to form spherical droplets when spilled.
5. **Thermal Conductivity**: Mercury has a low thermal conductivity compared to other metals.
6. **Electrical Conductivity**: Mercury is an excellent conductor of electricity.

## Chemical Properties of Mercury

### 1. Reaction with Air
- **Inert Nature**: Mercury is relatively inert in air at room temperature. It does not oxidize easily and thus retains its metallic luster.
- **At High Temperatures**: When heated, mercury reacts with oxygen to form mercury(II) oxide:
  $$
  \ce{2Hg (l) + O2 (g) -> 2HgO (s)}
  $$

### 2. Reaction with Acids
- **Non-Reactivity with Dilute Acids**: Mercury does not react with dilute acids, such as dilute hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, due to its high position in the electrochemical series.
- **Reaction with Concentrated Acids**:
  - **Concentrated Nitric Acid ($\ce{HNO3}$)**: Mercury dissolves in concentrated nitric acid to form mercury(II) nitrate:
    $$
    \ce{Hg (l) + 4HNO3 (aq) -> Hg(NO3)2 (aq) + 2NO2 (g) + 2H2O (l)}
    $$
  - **Concentrated Sulfuric Acid ($\ce{H2SO4}$)**: Mercury reacts with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid to form mercury(II) sulfate, sulfur dioxide, and water:
    $$
    \ce{Hg (l) + 2H2SO4 (aq) -> HgSO4 (s) + SO2 (g) + 2H2O (l)}
    $$

### 3. Reaction with Alkalis
- **Non-Reactivity with Alkalis**: Mercury does not react with alkalis such as sodium hydroxide ($\ce{NaOH}$) under normal conditions due to its stable electron configuration.

### 4. Amalgamation
- **Formation of Amalgams**: Mercury readily forms alloys called **amalgams** with many metals, including gold, silver, and zinc. This property is utilized in gold extraction and in dental fillings.

### 5. Reaction with Metal Ions
- **Formation of Mercury(II) Ions**: Mercury can react with other metal ions to form compounds where mercury exists as either $\ce{Hg^+}$ or $\ce{Hg^{2+}}$ ions, depending on the reaction conditions.

## Uses of Mercury

1. **Thermometers and Barometers**: Mercury is commonly used in thermometers and barometers due to its uniform thermal expansion and liquid state over a wide temperature range.
2. **Electrical Switches and Relays**: Mercury is an excellent conductor and is used in various switches, relays, and rectifiers.
3. **Gold and Silver Extraction**: Mercury is used in amalgamation to extract gold and silver from ores.
4. **Fluorescent Lamps**: Mercury vapor is used in fluorescent and mercury-vapor lamps.
5. **Dental Amalgams**: Mercury is used in dental fillings, mixed with other metals to form a stable amalgam.

## Summary

Mercury is a unique element with a silver-white, metallic liquid state at room temperature, high density, and excellent electrical conductivity. It is relatively inert but can react with concentrated acids and oxygen at high temperatures. Mercury's unique properties have led to its use in thermometers, barometers, amalgamation processes, and electrical devices, though its toxicity has limited its applications.

# Physical Properties of Aniline

Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂), also known as **aminobenzene**, is a colorless to pale yellow liquid with distinct physical properties that are useful in identifying it in chemical reactions. Below are the key physical properties of aniline.

---

## **Appearance**

Aniline is typically a **colorless** liquid when freshly prepared, but it turns **yellow** upon exposure to air due to oxidation. It is a clear, oily liquid with a **slightly oily texture**.

---

## **Boiling Point**

The boiling point of aniline is approximately **184°C** (363°F), which is relatively high compared to other amines due to its aromatic structure. The boiling point is influenced by the **hydrogen bonding** between aniline molecules.

---

## **Melting Point**

Aniline has a melting point of **-6°C** (21°F), which is low, indicating that it is a liquid at room temperature. This low melting point is attributed to the **weak intermolecular forces** between its molecules.

---

## **Solubility**

- **In Water**: Aniline is **sparingly soluble** in water. The amino group ($\ce{-NH_2}$) can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, but the aromatic ring reduces its overall solubility in water.
  
- **In Organic Solvents**: Aniline is highly soluble in **organic solvents** such as ethanol, ether, and chloroform due to its non-polar aromatic ring and the hydrogen-bonding ability of the amine group.

---

## **Odor**

Aniline has a **distinctive, unpleasant odor**, which is often described as a **fishy** or **sweetish** smell. The odor is particularly noticeable in its liquid form.

---

## **Density**

The density of aniline is **1.02 g/cm³**, which makes it slightly **denser than water**. This characteristic is important in separation and purification processes involving aniline.

---

## **Refractive Index**

Aniline has a refractive index of **1.570**, which is typical for aromatic compounds. This property can be useful in identifying aniline in solution.

---

## Summary

- Aniline is a **colorless to pale yellow liquid** with a **distinctive odor**.
- It has a **boiling point of 184°C** and a **melting point of -6°C**.
- Aniline is **sparingly soluble in water** but highly soluble in organic solvents.
- Its density is **1.02 g/cm³**, and it has a **refractive index of 1.570**.

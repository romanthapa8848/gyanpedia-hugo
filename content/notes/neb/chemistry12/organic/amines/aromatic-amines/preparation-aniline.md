# Preparation of Aniline from Nitrobenzene, Phenol

Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂), also known as **aminobenzene**, is an important aromatic amine widely used in the manufacture of dyes, drugs, and other organic chemicals. It can be prepared from various precursors such as **nitrobenzene** and **phenol**. The following methods outline the preparation of aniline from these compounds.

## **Preparation of Aniline from Nitrobenzene**

The reduction of **nitrobenzene** to aniline is one of the most common methods for preparing aniline. This reduction process is typically carried out in the presence of reducing agents, such as **iron (Fe)** with **hydrochloric acid (HCl)** or **tin (Sn)** with **HCl**.

### **Method: Reduction using Iron and HCl**

1. **Reaction**:
   $$\ce{C_6H_5NO_2 + 3[H] → C_6H_5NH_2 + 2H_2O}$$
   
2. **Reagents**: 
   - Nitrobenzene ($\ce{C_6H_5NO_2}$)
   - Iron powder ($\ce{Fe}$)
   - Hydrochloric acid ($\ce{HCl}$)
   
3. **Mechanism**: 
   In the presence of iron filings and hydrochloric acid, nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline. The iron acts as a reducing agent, donating electrons to reduce the $\ce{NO_2}$ group to an amine group ($\ce{NH_2}$).

**Product**: Aniline ($\ce{C_6H_5NH_2}$)

## **Preparation of Aniline from Phenol**

Aniline can also be synthesized from **phenol** through a **reduction** process, where phenol is first nitrated to form a nitrophenol, which is then reduced to aniline.

### **Method: Reduction of Nitro Phenol**

1. **Reaction**:
   $$\ce{C_6H_5OH + HNO_3 → C_6H_4(NO_2)OH}$$
   $$\ce{C_6H_4(NO_2)OH + 3[H] → C_6H_5NH_2 + 2H_2O}$$

2. **Reagents**: 
   - Phenol ($\ce{C_6H_5OH}$)
   - Nitric acid ($\ce{HNO_3}$)
   - Reducing agents such as **iron (Fe)** or **tin (Sn)** in **HCl**

**Mechanism**: 
- **Step 1**: Phenol undergoes nitration using nitric acid to form **nitrophenol**.
- **Step 2**: The nitrophenol is then reduced using reducing agents like iron and hydrochloric acid to form **aniline**.

**Product**: Aniline ($\ce{C_6H_5NH_2}$)

## Summary

- **From Nitrobenzene**: The reduction of nitrobenzene with iron and hydrochloric acid is the most common method for preparing aniline. This reaction reduces the nitro group ($\ce{NO_2}$) to an amine group ($\ce{NH_2}$).
- **From Phenol**: Phenol can be nitrated to form nitrophenol, which is then reduced to aniline using a reducing agent like iron in hydrochloric acid.

# Preparation of Nitroalkanes from Haloalkanes and Alkanes

## 1. Preparation from Haloalkanes

Nitroalkanes can be prepared from haloalkanes (alkyl halides) by nucleophilic substitution reactions. The nitro group ($\ce{-NO2}$) replaces the halogen atom in the haloalkane to form the nitroalkane. 

### Reaction Mechanism
- **Reagent**: Silver nitrite ($\ce{AgNO2}$)  
- **Reaction**: The $\ce{-NO2}$ group of silver nitrite acts as a nucleophile and replaces the halogen in the haloalkane.  
- **Mechanism**: This reaction proceeds via an $S_\text{N}2$ mechanism.

### General Reaction
$$
\ce{R-X + AgNO2 -> R-NO2 + AgX}
$$
- $\ce{R-X}$: Haloalkane  
- $\ce{R-NO2}$: Nitroalkane  
- $\ce{AgX}$: Silver halide (precipitate)  

### Example
$$
\ce{CH3Cl + AgNO2 -> CH3NO2 + AgCl}
$$
- **Reactants**: Methyl chloride ($\ce{CH3Cl}$) and silver nitrite ($\ce{AgNO2}$)  
- **Product**: Nitromethane ($\ce{CH3NO2}$)  

**Note**: This reaction gives nitroalkanes, not alkyl nitrites ($\ce{R-ONO}$), because silver nitrite has a polar $\ce{C-NO2}$ bond, which favors the formation of nitroalkanes.

## 2. Preparation from Alkanes

Nitroalkanes can also be prepared by direct nitration of alkanes using concentrated nitric acid. This method is useful for producing nitroalkanes in bulk quantities but often results in a mixture of products.

### Reaction Mechanism
- **Reagents**: Fuming nitric acid ($\ce{HNO3}$)  
- **Conditions**: High temperature (300–500°C)  
- **Mechanism**: Free radical substitution mechanism, where a hydrogen atom in the alkane is replaced by a nitro group ($\ce{-NO2}$).  

### General Reaction
$$
\ce{R-H + HNO3 -> R-NO2 + H2O}
$$
- $\ce{R-H}$: Alkane  
- $\ce{R-NO2}$: Nitroalkane  

### Example
$$
\ce{CH4 + HNO3 -> CH3NO2 + H2O}
$$
- **Reactants**: Methane ($\ce{CH4}$) and nitric acid ($\ce{HNO3}$)  
- **Product**: Nitromethane ($\ce{CH3NO2}$)  

**Note**: The nitration of alkanes often gives a mixture of nitroalkanes due to substitution at different carbon atoms.

## Summary

- Nitroalkanes can be prepared from haloalkanes through nucleophilic substitution using silver nitrite.
- They can also be prepared from alkanes by direct nitration with concentrated nitric acid.
- The reaction with haloalkanes is more selective, while nitration of alkanes often results in mixtures.

## FAQs

### 1. What reagents are used for preparing nitroalkanes from haloalkanes?
Silver nitrite ($\ce{AgNO2}$) is used for the preparation of nitroalkanes from haloalkanes.

### 2. What type of reaction occurs between haloalkanes and silver nitrite?
A nucleophilic substitution ($S_\text{N}2$) reaction occurs.

### 3. What is the product of the reaction between $\ce{CH3Cl}$ and $\ce{AgNO2}$?
The product is nitromethane ($\ce{CH3NO2}$).

### 4. What conditions are required for the nitration of alkanes?
High temperature (300–500°C) and concentrated nitric acid ($\ce{HNO3}$) are required.

### 5. What is the mechanism of alkane nitration?
The nitration of alkanes follows a free radical substitution mechanism.

### 6. Why does nitration of alkanes give a mixture of products?
The mixture forms because the nitro group can replace hydrogen atoms at different positions on the alkane chain.

### 7. What is the general formula of nitroalkanes?
The general formula is $\ce{R-NO2}$.

### 8. Can alkyl nitrites be formed in the reaction with haloalkanes?
No, silver nitrite favors the formation of nitroalkanes due to its polar $\ce{C-NO2}$ bond.

### 9. Why is silver nitrite used in the preparation of nitroalkanes?
Silver nitrite ensures selective substitution, forming nitroalkanes instead of alkyl nitrites.

### 10. What is the by-product in the reaction of haloalkanes with silver nitrite?
The by-product is silver halide ($\ce{AgX}$), which forms as a precipitate.

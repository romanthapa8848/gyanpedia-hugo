# Chemical Properties of Nitrobenzene

Nitrobenzene exhibits various chemical properties due to the presence of the nitro group ($\ce{-NO2}$), which significantly affects the reactivity of the benzene ring. Some important reactions are discussed below:

---

## 1. Reduction Reactions

### (a) Partial Reduction
- When nitrobenzene is reduced using reagents such as $\ce{Sn}$ and $\ce{HCl}$ or $\ce{Fe}$ and $\ce{HCl}$, it produces aniline ($\ce{C6H5NH2}$).

$$
\ce{C6H5NO2 + 6[H] -> C6H5NH2 + 2H2O}
$$

### (b) Complete Reduction
- On treatment with a strong reducing agent like $\ce{Zn}$ and $\ce{NaOH}$, nitrobenzene is completely reduced to phenylhydroxylamine ($\ce{C6H5NHOH}$).

$$
\ce{C6H5NO2 + 4[H] -> C6H5NHOH + H2O}
$$

---

## 2. Electrophilic Substitution Reactions

The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, deactivating the benzene ring and directing incoming electrophiles to the meta position.

### (a) Nitration
- Nitrobenzene reacts with a mixture of concentrated $\ce{HNO3}$ and $\ce{H2SO4}$ at high temperatures to form meta-dinitrobenzene.

$$
\ce{C6H5NO2 + HNO3 -> C6H4(NO2)2 + H2O}
$$

### (b) Sulfonation
- On heating with concentrated $\ce{H2SO4}$, nitrobenzene undergoes sulfonation to yield meta-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.

$$
\ce{C6H5NO2 + H2SO4 -> C6H4(NO2)(SO3H) + H2O}
$$

### (c) Halogenation
- In the presence of a Lewis acid like $\ce{FeCl3}$, nitrobenzene undergoes halogenation to form meta-nitrochlorobenzene or meta-nitrobromobenzene.

$$
\ce{C6H5NO2 + Cl2 -> C6H4(NO2)(Cl) + HCl}
$$

## Summary

Nitrobenzene exhibits a variety of chemical reactions, primarily influenced by the electron-withdrawing nitro group. These reactions include reductions (partial and complete) and electrophilic substitutions like nitration, sulfonation, and halogenation. The meta-directing effect of the $\ce{-NO2}$ group is a significant characteristic in substitution reactions.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the result of partially reducing nitrobenzene?
The partial reduction of nitrobenzene yields aniline ($\ce{C6H5NH2}$).

### 2. What happens when nitrobenzene undergoes complete reduction?
Complete reduction of nitrobenzene forms phenylhydroxylamine ($\ce{C6H5NHOH}$).

### 3. What is the effect of the nitro group on the benzene ring?
The nitro group is electron-withdrawing, deactivates the benzene ring, and directs electrophiles to the meta position.

### 4. Which reagent is used for the nitration of nitrobenzene?
A mixture of concentrated $\ce{HNO3}$ and $\ce{H2SO4}$ is used for nitration.

### 5. What is the product of sulfonation of nitrobenzene?
The sulfonation of nitrobenzene yields meta-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.

### 6. Why is nitrobenzene less reactive towards electrophilic substitution?
The electron-withdrawing nitro group decreases the electron density on the benzene ring, making it less reactive towards electrophiles.

### 7. Which position does nitrobenzene favor in substitution reactions?
Nitrobenzene favors substitution at the meta position.

### 8. What happens when nitrobenzene reacts with chlorine in the presence of $\ce{FeCl3}$?
It forms meta-nitrochlorobenzene.

### 9. Can nitrobenzene undergo Friedel-Crafts reactions?
No, nitrobenzene does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reactions due to the deactivating nature of the $\ce{-NO2}$ group.

### 10. What is the role of $\ce{Fe}$ and $\ce{HCl}$ in the reduction of nitrobenzene?
$\ce{Fe}$ and $\ce{HCl}$ act as reducing agents, converting nitrobenzene into aniline.

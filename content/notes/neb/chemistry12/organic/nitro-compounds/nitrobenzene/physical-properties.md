# Physical Properties of Nitrobenzene

Nitrobenzene is an aromatic compound with distinct physical characteristics that make it important in industrial and laboratory applications. Below are its key physical properties:

## Appearance
Nitrobenzene is a pale yellow liquid at room temperature. It may darken upon exposure to light or air due to oxidation.

## Odor
It has a characteristic almond-like odor, which is quite strong.

## Density
Nitrobenzene is denser than water, with a density of approximately **1.20 g/cm³** at 20°C.

## Boiling Point
Nitrobenzene has a boiling point of **210°C**, which is relatively high due to strong intermolecular interactions like dipole-dipole forces.

## Melting Point
Its melting point is **5°C**, which means it solidifies just below room temperature.

## Solubility
- Nitrobenzene is sparingly soluble in water (0.2 g/100 mL at 20°C).
- It is highly soluble in organic solvents such as alcohol, ether, and benzene.

## Refractive Index
The refractive index of nitrobenzene is approximately **1.551 at 20°C**, indicating its optical properties.

## Stability
Nitrobenzene is stable under normal conditions but can decompose under high temperatures or prolonged exposure to light.

## Summary
Nitrobenzene is a pale yellow, aromatic liquid with an almond-like odor. It has a high boiling point, moderate solubility in water, and good solubility in organic solvents. Its density and refractive index are characteristic of aromatic nitro compounds.

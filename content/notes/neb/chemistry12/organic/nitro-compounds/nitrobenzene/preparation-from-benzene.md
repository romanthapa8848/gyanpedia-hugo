# Preparation of Nitrobenzene from Benzene

Nitrobenzene is prepared from benzene through a process called **nitration**, which is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. This reaction involves treating benzene with a nitrating mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid.

## Reaction Mechanism

The nitration of benzene proceeds in the following steps:

1. **Generation of Electrophile**: 
   - The reaction mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid ($\ce{H2SO4}$) and concentrated nitric acid ($\ce{HNO3}$) produces the nitronium ion ($\ce{NO2+}$), which acts as the electrophile:
     $$
     \ce{H2SO4 + HNO3 -> HSO4- + NO2+ + H2O}
     $$

2. **Electrophilic Attack on Benzene**:
   - The $\ce{NO2+}$ ion attacks the electron-rich benzene ring, forming a resonance-stabilized carbocation (an arenium ion).

3. **Restoration of Aromaticity**:
   - The hydrogen atom bonded to the carbon atom attacked by $\ce{NO2+}$ is removed by $\ce{HSO4-}$, restoring the aromaticity of the benzene ring and forming nitrobenzene.

## General Reaction:

$$
\ce{C6H6 + HNO3 ->[H2SO4] C6H5NO2 + H2O}
$$

Here, benzene reacts with nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid to form nitrobenzene and water.

## Summary

- Nitrobenzene is prepared by the nitration of benzene using a mixture of concentrated $\ce{H2SO4}$ and $\ce{HNO3}$.
- The reaction proceeds via electrophilic substitution, with the formation of a nitronium ion ($\ce{NO2+}$) as the electrophile.
- The overall reaction is:
  $$
  \ce{C6H6 + HNO3 ->[H2SO4] C6H5NO2 + H2O}
  $$

## FAQs

### 1. What is the nitrating mixture used for the preparation of nitrobenzene?
The nitrating mixture is a combination of concentrated sulfuric acid ($\ce{H2SO4}$) and concentrated nitric acid ($\ce{HNO3}$).

### 2. What is the electrophile in the nitration of benzene?
The electrophile is the nitronium ion ($\ce{NO2+}$).

### 3. How is the nitronium ion ($\ce{NO2+}$) formed?
The nitronium ion is formed by the reaction between concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid:
$$
\ce{H2SO4 + HNO3 -> HSO4- + NO2+ + H2O}
$$

### 4. What type of reaction is the nitration of benzene?
It is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.

### 5. Why is sulfuric acid used in the nitration of benzene?
Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst and protonates nitric acid to generate the nitronium ion ($\ce{NO2+}$).

### 6. What is the product of nitration of benzene?
The product is nitrobenzene ($\ce{C6H5NO2}$).

### 7. Is heat required for the nitration of benzene?
Yes, mild heating is typically required to facilitate the reaction.

### 8. Can benzene undergo nitration without sulfuric acid?
No, sulfuric acid is essential for generating the nitronium ion ($\ce{NO2+}$), which is the electrophile in the reaction.

### 9. What happens if the reaction temperature is too high during nitration?
At high temperatures, multiple nitro groups may substitute onto the benzene ring, leading to dinitrobenzene or trinitrobenzene.

### 10. Why is nitration of benzene important?
The nitration of benzene is an industrially significant reaction as nitrobenzene is a precursor to aniline and other important chemicals.

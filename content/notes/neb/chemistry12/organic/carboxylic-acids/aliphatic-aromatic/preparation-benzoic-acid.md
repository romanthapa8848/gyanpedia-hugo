# Preparation of Benzoic Acid from Alkyl Benzene

Benzoic acid can be prepared from alkyl benzenes by oxidation reactions. The alkyl group attached to the benzene ring can be oxidized to a carboxyl group, leading to the formation of benzoic acid.

---

## 1. Oxidation with Potassium Permanganate

The most common method to prepare benzoic acid from alkyl benzenes involves oxidation with potassium permanganate ($\ce{KMnO_4}$). Potassium permanganate is a strong oxidizing agent and can oxidize the alkyl side chain of alkyl benzenes to a carboxyl group, resulting in the formation of benzoic acid.

### General Reaction:
$$\ce{C6H5-CH3 + 2[O] → C6H5-COOH}$$

- **Example:**
  - **Toluene** ($\ce{C6H5-CH3}$) undergoes oxidation with potassium permanganate to form **benzoic acid** ($\ce{C6H5-COOH}$).

---

## 2. Oxidation with Chromic Acid

Chromic acid ($\ce{H_2CrO_4}$) is another strong oxidizing agent used for the oxidation of alkyl benzenes. It similarly oxidizes the alkyl group to a carboxyl group, producing benzoic acid.

### General Reaction:
$$\ce{C6H5-CH3 + H_2CrO_4 → C6H5-COOH}$$

- **Example:**
  - **Toluene** can also be oxidized with chromic acid to form **benzoic acid**.

---

## 3. Oxidation with Nitric Acid

Nitric acid ($\ce{HNO_3}$) is another oxidizing agent that can be used to oxidize alkyl benzenes to benzoic acid. However, nitric acid is less commonly used than potassium permanganate or chromic acid.

### General Reaction:
$$\ce{C6H5-CH3 + HNO_3 → C6H5-COOH + NO_2}$$

- **Example:**
  - **Toluene** reacts with nitric acid to form **benzoic acid**.

---

## Summary

- **Potassium permanganate** is the most commonly used reagent for the oxidation of alkyl benzenes to benzoic acid.
- **Chromic acid** and **nitric acid** can also be used to oxidize alkyl groups on the benzene ring to carboxyl groups, yielding benzoic acid.

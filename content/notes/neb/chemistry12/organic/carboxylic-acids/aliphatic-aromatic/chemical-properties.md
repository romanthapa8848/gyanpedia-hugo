# Chemical Properties of Carboxylic Acids

Carboxylic acids exhibit a range of characteristic chemical reactions due to the presence of the carboxyl group ($\ce{-COOH}$). These reactions play an important role in the preparation of various derivatives and functional group transformations. The key chemical properties of carboxylic acids are their reactions with bases, metal oxides, carbonates, and various reagents like PCl₃ and LiAlH₄.

## 1. Reaction with Alkalies

Carboxylic acids react with alkalies to form salts and water. The reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alkali is a neutralization reaction. The product is a carboxylate salt.

$$
\ce{RCOOH + NaOH \rightarrow RCOONa + H_2O}
$$

### Example:
- **Acetic acid** reacts with sodium hydroxide to form **sodium acetate**:
  $$
  \ce{CH_3COOH + NaOH \rightarrow CH_3COONa + H_2O}
  $$

---

## 2. Reaction with Metal Oxides

Carboxylic acids react with metal oxides to form metal carboxylates and water.

$$
\ce{RCOOH + MO \rightarrow RCOOM + H_2O}
$$

### Example:
- **Acetic acid** reacts with calcium oxide to form **calcium acetate**:
  $$
  \ce{2CH_3COOH + CaO \rightarrow (CH_3COO)_2Ca + H_2O}
  $$

---

## 3. Reaction with Metal Carbonates

Carboxylic acids react with metal carbonates to form metal carboxylates, carbon dioxide, and water. This is an acid-base reaction where the acid neutralizes the carbonate.

$$
\ce{2RCOOH + MCO_3 \rightarrow (RCOO)_2M + CO_2 + H_2O}
$$

### Example:
- **Acetic acid** reacts with sodium carbonate to form **sodium acetate**, carbon dioxide, and water:
  $$
  \ce{2CH_3COOH + Na_2CO_3 \rightarrow 2CH_3COONa + CO_2 + H_2O}
  $$

---

## 4. Reaction with Metal Bicarbonates

When carboxylic acids react with metal bicarbonates, metal carboxylates, carbon dioxide, and water are produced.

$$
\ce{2RCOOH + MBHCO_3 \rightarrow (RCOO)_2M + CO_2 + H_2O}
$$

### Example:
- **Acetic acid** reacts with sodium bicarbonate to form **sodium acetate**, carbon dioxide, and water:
  $$
  \ce{2CH_3COOH + NaHCO_3 \rightarrow 2CH_3COONa + CO_2 + H_2O}
  $$

---

## 5. Reaction with PCl₃ (Phosphorus Trichloride)

Carboxylic acids react with **phosphorus trichloride (PCl₃)** to form acyl chlorides (acid chlorides) by substitution of the hydroxyl group ($\ce{-OH}$) with chlorine.

$$
\ce{RCOOH + PCl_3 \rightarrow RCOCl + HCl}
$$

### Example:
- **Acetic acid** reacts with phosphorus trichloride to form **acetyl chloride**:
  $$
  \ce{CH_3COOH + PCl_3 \rightarrow CH_3COCl + HCl}
  $$

---

## 6. Reaction with LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminum Hydride)

**Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄)** is a strong reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols by reducing the $\ce{C=O}$ bond of the carboxyl group.

$$
\ce{RCOOH + 4[H] \rightarrow RCH_2OH + H_2O}
$$

### Example:
- **Acetic acid** is reduced to **ethanol**:
  $$
  \ce{CH_3COOH + 4[H] \rightarrow CH_3CH_2OH + H_2O}
  $$

---

## 7. Dehydration of Carboxylic Acid

Carboxylic acids undergo dehydration under certain conditions (usually in the presence of a dehydrating agent like **phosphorus pentoxide (P₄O₁₀)**) to form acid anhydrides.

$$
\ce{2RCOOH \xrightarrow{P_4O_{10}} (RCO)_2O + H_2O}
$$

### Example:
- **Acetic acid** is dehydrated to form **acetic anhydride**:
  $$
  \ce{2CH_3COOH \xrightarrow{P_4O_{10}} (CH_3CO)_2O + H_2O}
  $$

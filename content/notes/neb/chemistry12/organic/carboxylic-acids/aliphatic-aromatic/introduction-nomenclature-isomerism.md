# Aliphatic and Aromatic Carboxylic Acids: Introduction, Nomenclature, and Isomerism

Carboxylic acids are organic compounds containing a carboxyl group ($\ce{-COOH}$). They are classified into two categories: aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids. This chapter will introduce these compounds and explain their nomenclature and isomerism.

## 1. Introduction to Carboxylic Acids

Carboxylic acids are characterized by the presence of the carboxyl group ($\ce{-COOH}$), which consists of a carbonyl group ($\ce{C=O}$) attached to a hydroxyl group ($\ce{-OH}$). The general formula for a carboxylic acid is $\ce{R-COOH}$, where $\ce{R}$ is a hydrocarbon group. These acids are widely found in nature and have significant industrial applications.

- **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids:** These acids have straight or branched chains of carbon atoms attached to the carboxyl group. Common examples include acetic acid ($\ce{CH_3COOH}$) and formic acid ($\ce{HCOOH}$).
- **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids:** These acids contain a carboxyl group attached to an aromatic ring. A well-known example is benzoic acid ($\ce{C_6H_5COOH}$).

## 2. Nomenclature of Carboxylic Acids

The nomenclature of carboxylic acids depends on whether the compound is aliphatic or aromatic.

- **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids:**
  - The parent name is derived from the alkane chain, replacing the suffix "-e" with "-oic acid."
  - Example: Methane ($\ce{CH_4}$) becomes **methanoic acid** (formic acid), and ethane ($\ce{C_2H_6}$) becomes **ethanoic acid** (acetic acid).
  
- **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids:**
  - The name is based on the benzene ring. If the carboxyl group is attached to the benzene ring, the acid is named **benzoic acid**.
  - If there are substituents on the benzene ring, their positions are specified with numbers (1,2,3, etc.).
  - Example: **Benzene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid** (phthalic acid) and **benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid** (isophthalic acid).

## 3. Isomerism in Carboxylic Acids

Carboxylic acids can exhibit different types of isomerism:

- **Structural Isomerism:**
  - Carboxylic acids with the same molecular formula may differ in the position of the carboxyl group or in the branching of the carbon chain.
  - Example: **Butanoic acid** ($\ce{C_3H_7COOH}$) and **2-methylpropanoic acid** ($\ce{CH_3CH(COOH)CH_3}$).

- **Functional Group Isomerism:**
  - Carboxylic acids can have different functional groups but the same molecular formula.
  - Example: **Ethanol** ($\ce{CH_3CH_2OH}$) and **Acetic acid** ($\ce{CH_3COOH}$) are functional group isomers.

- **Geometrical Isomerism:**
  - In certain cases, the carboxyl group may exhibit cis-trans isomerism, but this is less common in simple aliphatic acids.

## Summary

- **Introduction:** Carboxylic acids are compounds containing a $\ce{-COOH}$ group, divided into aliphatic and aromatic categories.
- **Nomenclature:** Aliphatic acids are named by replacing "-e" with "-oic acid," while aromatic acids are named based on the benzene ring.
- **Isomerism:** Carboxylic acids exhibit structural, functional group, and occasionally geometrical isomerism.

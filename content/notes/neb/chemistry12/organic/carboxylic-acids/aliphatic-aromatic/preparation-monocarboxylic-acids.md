# Preparation of Monocarboxylic Acids from Aldehydes, Nitriles, Dicarboxylic Acid, Sodium Alkoxide, and Trihaloalkanes

Monocarboxylic acids can be synthesized through various reactions starting from different organic compounds. This section discusses the preparation methods of monocarboxylic acids from aldehydes, nitriles, dicarboxylic acids, sodium alkoxides, and trihaloalkanes.

## 1. Preparation from Aldehydes

Aldehydes can be oxidized to monocarboxylic acids by treatment with strong oxidizing agents. The general reaction is as follows:

$$\ce{RCHO + [O] → RCOOH}$$

- **Example:**
  - **Acetaldehyde** ($\ce{CH_3CHO}$) on oxidation with potassium permanganate ($\ce{KMnO_4}$) forms **acetic acid** ($\ce{CH_3COOH}$).

---

## 2. Preparation from Nitriles

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to form carboxylic acids. The nitrile undergoes nucleophilic addition of water under acidic or basic conditions, producing the corresponding acid:

$$\ce{R-CN + 2H_2O → R-COOH + NH_3}$$

- **Example:**
  - **Acetonitrile** ($\ce{CH_3CN}$) hydrolyzed with water and acid forms **acetic acid** ($\ce{CH_3COOH}$).

---

## 3. Preparation from Dicarboxylic Acids

Dicarboxylic acids can be decarboxylated to give monocarboxylic acids. One of the carboxyl groups is removed as carbon dioxide:

$$\ce{HOOC-R-COOH → R-COOH + CO_2}$$

- **Example:**
  - **Succinic acid** ($\ce{CH_2(CO_2H)-CH_2(CO_2H)}$) undergoes decarboxylation to form **acetic acid** ($\ce{CH_3COOH}$).

---

## 4. Preparation from Sodium Alkoxides

When sodium alkoxides react with carbonyl compounds, they undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution to form carboxylic acids. This is a method to prepare carboxylate salts, which can be converted to the corresponding acids.

$$\ce{R-O-Na + R'-COCl → R-COOH + NaCl}$$

- **Example:**
  - **Sodium methoxide** ($\ce{CH_3O-Na}$) reacts with **acetyl chloride** ($\ce{CH_3COCl}$) to form **acetic acid** ($\ce{CH_3COOH}$).

---

## 5. Preparation from Trihaloalkanes

Trihaloalkanes, such as trichloroalkanes, undergo nucleophilic substitution with aqueous hydroxide to form carboxylic acids. This process typically involves the formation of a carboxylate ion, which upon protonation yields the carboxylic acid.

$$\ce{CX_3CH_2 + 3OH^- → R-COOH + 3Cl^-}$$

- **Example:**
  - **Trichloroethane** ($\ce{CCl_3CH_2}$) can be converted to **acetic acid** ($\ce{CH_3COOH}$) by reaction with aqueous hydroxide.

---

## Summary

- **Aldehydes** can be oxidized to monocarboxylic acids.
- **Nitriles** can be hydrolyzed to produce carboxylic acids.
- **Dicarboxylic acids** undergo decarboxylation to yield monocarboxylic acids.
- **Sodium alkoxides** can react with acyl compounds to form carboxylic acids.
- **Trihaloalkanes** react with hydroxides to form carboxylic acids.

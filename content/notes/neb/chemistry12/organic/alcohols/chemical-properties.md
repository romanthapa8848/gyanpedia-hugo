# Chemical Properties of Monohydric Alcohols

Monohydric alcohols exhibit several important chemical reactions due to the presence of the hydroxyl group (-OH). The chemical properties of monohydric alcohols are largely determined by their ability to undergo reactions like oxidation, dehydration, esterification, and nucleophilic substitution. Below are the key chemical properties of monohydric alcohols.

## 1. **Oxidation**

Monohydric alcohols can be **oxidized** to form aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids, depending on the type of alcohol and the oxidizing agent used. 

- **Primary alcohols** (e.g., ethanol) are oxidized to **aldehydes** (e.g., ethanal) and further to **carboxylic acids** (e.g., acetic acid).
- **Secondary alcohols** (e.g., isopropanol) are oxidized to **ketones** (e.g., acetone).
- **Tertiary alcohols** are generally resistant to oxidation because there is no hydrogen atom attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group.

### Example:
- **Primary alcohol**:  
  $$ \ce{CH3CH2OH} \xrightarrow{[O]} \ce{CH3CHO} \xrightarrow{[O]} \ce{CH3COOH} $$

### Reagents:
- Common oxidizing agents include **KMnO4** (potassium permanganate), **K2Cr2O7** (potassium dichromate), and **PCC** (Pyridinium chlorochromate).

## 2. **Dehydration**

Monohydric alcohols undergo **dehydration** in the presence of an acid catalyst, typically concentrated **H2SO4**, to form alkenes. This reaction involves the elimination of a water molecule from the alcohol.

- **Example**:  
  $$ \ce{CH3CH2OH} \xrightarrow{H_2SO_4} \ce{CH2=CH2} + H_2O $$  
  (Ethanol to ethene)

## 3. **Esterification**

Monohydric alcohols can react with **carboxylic acids** to form **esters** in a reaction known as **esterification**. This is a typical **nucleophilic acyl substitution** reaction.

- **Example**:  
  $$ \ce{CH3COOH} + \ce{CH3OH} \xrightarrow{H_2SO_4} \ce{CH3COOCH3} + H_2O $$  
  (Acetic acid and methanol to methyl acetate)

The reaction is usually catalyzed by concentrated **sulfuric acid (H2SO4)**, which helps in removing water and driving the reaction to completion.

## 4. **Reaction with Active Metals**

Monohydric alcohols react with **active metals** like sodium and potassium, releasing **hydrogen gas** and forming alkoxides.

- **Example**:  
  $$ \ce{2CH3OH} + \ce{2Na} \xrightarrow{} \ce{2CH3ONa} + \ce{H2} $$  
  (Methanol reacts with sodium)

This reaction is typical for alcohols due to the **acidity** of the hydroxyl group.

## 5. **Reaction with Halogenating Agents**

Monohydric alcohols can undergo a **substitution** reaction with halogenating agents like **PCl3** (phosphorus trichloride), **SOCl2** (thionyl chloride), or **PX3** to form **alkyl halides**.

- **Example**:  
  $$ \ce{CH3CH2OH} + \ce{PCl3} \xrightarrow{} \ce{CH3CH2Cl} + \ce{HCl} + \ce{POCl3} $$  
  (Ethanol reacts with phosphorus trichloride to form ethyl chloride)

## 6. **Acidic Reactions**

Monohydric alcohols are weakly acidic and can react with **strong bases** to form alkoxides. The reaction is a **deprotonation** of the hydroxyl group.

- **Example**:  
  $$ \ce{CH3OH} + \ce{NaOH} \xrightarrow{} \ce{CH3ONa} + \ce{H2O} $$  
  (Methanol reacts with sodium hydroxide)

## 7. **Formation of Peroxides**

Monohydric alcohols, especially **secondary** and **tertiary alcohols**, can form **peroxides** upon exposure to air or light. The hydroxyl group in alcohols can react with molecular oxygen to form **hydroperoxides**.

- **Example**:  
  $$ \ce{RCH2OH} + \ce{O2} \rightarrow \ce{RCH2OOH} $$  
  (Formation of a hydroperoxide from an alcohol)

## 8. **Reactions with Acid Chlorides**

Alcohols can also react with **acid chlorides** to form **esters**. This is another example of **nucleophilic acyl substitution**.

- **Example**:  
  $$ \ce{CH3COCl} + \ce{CH3OH} \xrightarrow{} \ce{CH3COOCH3} + \ce{HCl} $$  
  (Acetyl chloride reacts with methanol to form methyl acetate)

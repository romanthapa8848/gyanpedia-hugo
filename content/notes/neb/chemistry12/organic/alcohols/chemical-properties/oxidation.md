# Oxidation of Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Alcohols with Mild Oxidizing Agents

The oxidation of alcohols with **mild oxidizing agents**, such as **acidified potassium permanganate (KMnO₄)** and **acidified potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇)**, is an important reaction in organic chemistry. These reagents can selectively oxidize alcohols, depending on the nature of the alcohol (primary, secondary, or tertiary). 

## General Reaction with Mild Oxidizing Agents

Mild oxidizing agents like **KMnO₄** or **K₂Cr₂O₇** oxidize alcohols through the following steps:

1. **Primary Alcohols**: Oxidation of primary alcohols leads to the formation of **aldehydes** initially, which are then further oxidized to **carboxylic acids**.
2. **Secondary Alcohols**: Secondary alcohols are oxidized to **ketones**.
3. **Tertiary Alcohols**: Tertiary alcohols generally do not undergo oxidation with mild oxidizing agents because there is no hydrogen atom attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group.

## 1. Oxidation of Primary Alcohols

Primary alcohols are oxidized to **aldehydes** and then further to **carboxylic acids** when treated with **acidified KMnO₄** or **acidified K₂Cr₂O₇**. The reaction can be represented as:

- **Oxidation of Ethanol to Acetic Acid**:
  $$ \ce{CH₃CH₂OH \xrightarrow{KMnO₄, H⁺} CH₃COOH} $$  
  (Ethanol is oxidized to acetic acid)

## 2. Oxidation of Secondary Alcohols

Secondary alcohols are oxidized to **ketones** under similar conditions. 

- **Oxidation of Isopropyl Alcohol to Acetone**:
  $$ \ce{(CH₃)₂CHOH \xrightarrow{KMnO₄, H⁺} (CH₃)₂CO} $$  
  (Isopropyl alcohol is oxidized to acetone)

## 3. Oxidation of Tertiary Alcohols

Tertiary alcohols, due to the lack of a hydrogen atom on the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group, are **resistant** to oxidation with mild oxidizing agents. As a result, no oxidation occurs under these conditions.

- **Tertiary Alcohol (e.g., 2-Methyl-2-Propanol)**:
  $$ \ce{(CH₃)₃COH \xrightarrow{KMnO₄, H⁺} \text{No reaction}} $$  
  (No reaction occurs with a tertiary alcohol)

## Conditions for Oxidation

- **Oxidizing agents**: Acidified **KMnO₄** or **K₂Cr₂O₇** are used as oxidizing agents.
- **Temperature**: The reaction is carried out at room temperature or slightly elevated temperatures.
- **Solvent**: The reactions are typically performed in an aqueous medium, often with acidic conditions.

## Summary

- **Primary alcohols** are oxidized to **aldehydes** and further to **carboxylic acids**.
- **Secondary alcohols** are oxidized to **ketones**.
- **Tertiary alcohols** do not undergo oxidation with mild oxidizing agents because they lack the hydrogen atom necessary for oxidation.
- The reaction is commonly carried out using **acidified KMnO₄** or **K₂Cr₂O₇**.

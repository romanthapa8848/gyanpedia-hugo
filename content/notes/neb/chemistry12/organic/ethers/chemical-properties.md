# Chemical Properties of Ethoxyethane: Action with HI, Conc. $HCl$, Conc. $H_2SO_4$, Air, and $Cl_2$

Ethoxyethane, commonly known as diethyl ether, exhibits several important chemical reactions when it reacts with various reagents. These reactions highlight the reactivity of ethers and their ability to undergo substitution, oxidation, and cleavage under specific conditions.

## 1. Action with Hydrogen Iodide (HI)

When diethyl ether reacts with hydrogen iodide ($\ce{HI}$), it undergoes cleavage to form ethanol ($\ce{C_2H_5OH}$) and ethyl iodide ($\ce{C_2H_5I}$).

$$\ce{C_2H_5OC_2H_5 + HI -> C_2H_5I + C_2H_5OH}$$

This reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, where $\ce{I^-}$ attacks the ethoxy group, replacing it with an $\ce{I}$ atom.

## 2. Action with Concentrated Hydrochloric Acid ($\ce{HCl}$)

Diethyl ether undergoes cleavage when treated with concentrated $\ce{HCl}$, resulting in the formation of ethyl chloride ($\ce{C_2H_5Cl}$) and ethanol ($\ce{C_2H_5OH}$).

$$\ce{C_2H_5OC_2H_5 + HCl (conc.) -> C_2H_5Cl + C_2H_5OH}$$

In this reaction, $\ce{HCl}$ protonates the ether, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by chloride ions ($\ce{Cl^-}$).

## 3. Action with Concentrated Sulfuric Acid ($\ce{H_2SO_4}$)

When diethyl ether reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid ($\ce{H_2SO_4}$), it undergoes protonation followed by cleavage to form ethyl hydrogen sulfate ($\ce{C_2H_5OSO_3H}$) and ethanol ($\ce{C_2H_5OH}$).

$$\ce{C_2H_5OC_2H_5 + H_2SO_4 (conc.) -> C_2H_5OSO_3H + C_2H_5OH}$$

This reaction shows that concentrated $\ce{H_2SO_4}$ can act as a strong electrophile, promoting the cleavage of the ether bond.

## 4. Action with Air

When diethyl ether is exposed to air, it may undergo oxidation. Oxygen in the air can cause ethers to form peroxides, which are highly reactive and potentially explosive. The general reaction is:

$$\ce{2 C_2H_5OC_2H_5 + O_2 -> C_2H_5O-O-C_2H_5}$$

These peroxides can be dangerous if not handled carefully.

## 5. Action with Chlorine ($\ce{Cl_2}$)

Diethyl ether reacts with chlorine under UV light to form a mixture of chloro- and dichloro- derivatives, such as $\ce{C_2H_5Cl}$ and $\ce{C_2H_4Cl_2}$. This is an example of a free radical substitution reaction:

$$\ce{C_2H_5OC_2H_5 + Cl_2 (hv) -> C_2H_5Cl + C_2H_4Cl_2}$$

In this reaction, chlorine atoms replace hydrogen atoms from the ethyl group through a free radical mechanism, usually initiated by ultraviolet (UV) light.

# Formalin and Its Uses

Formalin is a solution of **methanal** ($\ce{HCHO}$), commonly known as formaldehyde, in water. It is typically a 37-40% aqueous solution of methanal and is widely used in various industries, particularly for its disinfectant, preservative, and sterilizing properties. It has numerous applications in healthcare, biological specimen preservation, and as a disinfectant in laboratories and hospitals.

## Uses of Formalin

### 1. **Preservative in Biological Specimens**

Formalin is used to preserve biological specimens, such as tissues, organs, and other samples, to prevent decay and maintain their structure for study. This makes it essential in medical and scientific research.

### 2. **Disinfectant**

Formalin is widely used as a disinfectant to sterilize surgical instruments, laboratory equipment, and environments in healthcare settings, such as hospitals.

### 3. **In the Production of Plastics and Resins**

Formalin is used in the production of phenolic resins and urea-formaldehyde resins, which are key components in the manufacture of plastic products, laminates, adhesives, and paints.

### 4. **In Embalming**

In the funeral industry, formalin is used in embalming fluids to preserve human remains. It prevents decomposition and provides long-term preservation of bodies.

### 5. **In the Synthesis of Other Chemicals**

Formalin is also used in the synthesis of various other chemicals, such as fertilizers, dyes, and pharmaceuticals, making it a valuable intermediate in chemical manufacturing.

### 6. **In the Manufacture of Foam Insulation**

Formalin is used in the production of foam insulation materials, which are widely used for thermal insulation in construction and other industries.

### 7. **In Water Treatment**

Formalin can be used to disinfect water and as a biocide to control the growth of bacteria and algae in cooling towers, swimming pools, and other water systems.

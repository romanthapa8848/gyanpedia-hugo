# Action of Methanal with Ammonia

When methanal ($\ce{HCHO}$) reacts with ammonia ($\ce{NH_3}$), it undergoes a condensation reaction to form imine (Schiff base). The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of ammonia on the carbonyl carbon of methanal, followed by the elimination of water.

## Reaction:

$$
\ce{HCHO + NH_3 \rightarrow CH_2=NH + H_2O}
$$

In this reaction:
- $\ce{HCHO}$ is methanal (formaldehyde),
- $\ce{NH_3}$ is ammonia,
- $\ce{CH_2=NH}$ is the imine (Schiff base), and
- $\ce{H_2O}$ is water.

# Action of Methanal with Phenol

When methanal reacts with phenol ($\ce{C_6H_5OH}$), it forms a product known as phenylmethanol, or in some cases, the reaction can lead to a condensation product. This is a nucleophilic addition-elimination reaction.

## Reaction:

$$
\ce{HCHO + C_6H_5OH \rightarrow C_6H_5CH_2OH}
$$

In this reaction:
- $\ce{HCHO}$ is methanal (formaldehyde),
- $\ce{C_6H_5OH}$ is phenol,
- $\ce{C_6H_5CH_2OH}$ is phenylmethanol (also known as benzyl alcohol).

This reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the oxygen atom of phenol on the carbonyl carbon of methanal, followed by the addition of a hydrogen atom to form the alcohol.

## Summary

- **Reaction with Ammonia**: Methanal reacts with ammonia to form an imine (Schiff base).
- **Reaction with Phenol**: Methanal reacts with phenol to form phenylmethanol (benzyl alcohol).

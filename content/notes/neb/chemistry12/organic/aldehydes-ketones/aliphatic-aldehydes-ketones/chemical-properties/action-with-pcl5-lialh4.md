# Action with PCl₅ (Phosphorus Pentachloride)

When aldehydes and ketones react with phosphorus pentachloride ($\ce{PCl_5}$), they undergo halogenation, replacing the hydroxyl group ($\ce{-OH}$) of the carbonyl compound with a chlorine atom ($\ce{-Cl}$). This reaction is often used to convert aldehydes and ketones into acyl chlorides (also known as acid chlorides).

## Reaction:

$$
\ce{RCHO + PCl_5 \rightarrow RCOCl + POCl_3 + HCl}
$$

In this reaction:
- $\ce{RCHO}$ represents an aldehyde (for example, acetaldehyde),
- $\ce{RCOCl}$ is the corresponding acyl chloride (for example, acetyl chloride),
- $\ce{POCl_3}$ is phosphorus oxychloride, and
- $\ce{HCl}$ is the hydrochloric acid formed.

Similarly, for ketones:

$$
\ce{R_2CO + PCl_5 \rightarrow R_2C(O)Cl + POCl_3 + HCl}
$$

In this case, $\ce{R_2CO}$ represents a ketone, and the result is the corresponding acyl chloride.

# Action with LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminum Hydride)

Lithium aluminum hydride ($\ce{LiAlH_4}$) is a strong reducing agent commonly used to reduce aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols. This reduction involves the donation of hydride ions ($\ce{H-}$) from $\ce{LiAlH_4}$ to the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde or ketone.

## Reaction with Aldehydes:

$$
\ce{RCHO + LiAlH_4 \rightarrow RCH_2OH}
$$

In this reaction:
- $\ce{RCHO}$ is an aldehyde (for example, acetaldehyde),
- $\ce{RCH_2OH}$ is the corresponding alcohol (for example, ethanol).

## Reaction with Ketones:

$$
\ce{R_2CO + LiAlH_4 \rightarrow R_2CHOH}
$$

Here, $\ce{R_2CO}$ represents a ketone, and $\ce{R_2CHOH}$ is the corresponding alcohol.

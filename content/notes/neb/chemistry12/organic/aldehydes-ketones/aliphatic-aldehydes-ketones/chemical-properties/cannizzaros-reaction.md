# Cannizzaro's Reaction

Cannizzaro's reaction is a redox reaction in which non-enolizable aldehydes (those lacking an $\alpha$-hydrogen) undergo disproportionation under basic conditions. In this reaction, one molecule of aldehyde is reduced to an alcohol, and another molecule is oxidized to a carboxylate anion. This reaction typically occurs in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH).

## Mechanism of Cannizzaro's Reaction

1. **Nucleophilic Attack on Carbonyl Group:**
   The strong base deprotonates the aldehyde, forming an alkoxide ion, which attacks the carbonyl group of another molecule of the aldehyde.

$$
\ce{2RCHO + OH^- \rightarrow [RCH(OH)-O]^{\ominus} + RCHO}
$$

2. **Disproportionation:**
   One of the alkoxide ions formed is protonated, resulting in the formation of an alcohol, while the other undergoes oxidation to form a carboxylate ion.

$$
\ce{RCH(OH)-O^{\ominus} \rightarrow RCH_2OH}
$$

3. **Formation of the Carboxylate Anion:**

$$
\ce{RCHO + OH^- \rightarrow RCOO^- + H_2O}
$$

Thus, the products of the reaction are an alcohol and a carboxylate anion.

## Example: Cannizzaro's Reaction with Formaldehyde

When formaldehyde ($\ce{HCHO}$) undergoes Cannizzaro's reaction, the products are methanol ($\ce{CH_3OH}$) and formate anion ($\ce{HCOO^-}$).

1. **Nucleophilic attack:**

$$
\ce{2HCHO + OH^- \rightarrow [HCH(OH)-O]^{\ominus} + HCHO}
$$

2. **Disproportionation to form methanol and formate anion:**

$$
\ce{HCH(OH)-O^{\ominus} \rightarrow CH_3OH}
$$

$$
\ce{HCHO + OH^- \rightarrow HCOO^- + H_2O}
$$

## FAQs

### 1. What type of aldehydes undergo Cannizzaro's reaction?

Non-enolizable aldehydes, which lack $\alpha$-hydrogens, undergo Cannizzaro's reaction.

### 2. What is the role of the base in Cannizzaro's reaction?

The base abstracts a proton from the aldehyde, generating an alkoxide ion that can attack another molecule of aldehyde.

### 3. What are the products of Cannizzaro's reaction?

The products of Cannizzaro's reaction are an alcohol and a carboxylate anion.

### 4. Can ketones undergo Cannizzaro's reaction?

No, Cannizzaro's reaction typically does not occur with ketones because they are usually enolizable and do not undergo the same disproportionation process.

### 5. What is an example of aldehyde undergoing Cannizzaro's reaction?

Formaldehyde ($\ce{HCHO}$) is a common example that undergoes Cannizzaro's reaction to form methanol and formate anion.

### 6. How does the disproportionation occur in Cannizzaro's reaction?

One molecule of aldehyde is reduced to an alcohol, while the other is oxidized to a carboxylate anion.

### 7. What is the significance of Cannizzaro's reaction in organic synthesis?

Cannizzaro's reaction provides a useful method for converting aldehydes into alcohols and carboxylate salts.

### 8. Can Cannizzaro's reaction happen without a base?

No, a strong base such as sodium hydroxide ($\ce{NaOH}$) is necessary for the reaction to occur.

### 9. What is the effect of the absence of $\alpha$-hydrogen in aldehydes?

The absence of $\alpha$-hydrogen makes the aldehyde non-enolizable and enables it to undergo Cannizzaro's reaction.

### 10. Is Cannizzaro's reaction a redox reaction?

Yes, Cannizzaro's reaction is a redox reaction where one aldehyde is reduced to an alcohol, and the other is oxidized to a carboxylate ion.

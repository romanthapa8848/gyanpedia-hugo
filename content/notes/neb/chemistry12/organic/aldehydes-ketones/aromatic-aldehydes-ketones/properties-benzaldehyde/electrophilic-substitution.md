# Properties of Benzaldehyde: Electrophilic Substitution Reaction

Benzaldehyde ($\ce{C_6H_5CHO}$) is an aromatic compound that undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions. The presence of the formyl group ($\ce{-CHO}$) on the benzene ring makes it reactive towards electrophiles. The formyl group is an electron-withdrawing group, which influences the positions on the aromatic ring where substitution is most likely to occur.

## Mechanism of Electrophilic Substitution

1. **Electron-Withdrawn Effect of $\ce{-CHO}$**: The formyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing due to its inductive and resonance effects. This deactivates the ring, making it less reactive to electrophiles, but it also makes the meta positions more reactive compared to the ortho and para positions.
   
2. **Substitution at Meta Position**: Because of the electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group, electrophilic substitution primarily occurs at the meta position relative to the $\ce{-CHO}$ group.

## Types of Electrophilic Substitution Reactions with Benzaldehyde

1. **Nitration of Benzaldehyde**:
   When benzaldehyde reacts with a nitrating mixture ($\ce{HNO_3 + H_2SO_4}$), a nitro group ($\ce{-NO_2}$) is introduced at the meta position.
   
   $$ \ce{C_6H_5CHO + HNO_3 \rightarrow meta-C_6H_4(NO_2)CHO} $$

2. **Sulphonation of Benzaldehyde**:
   When benzaldehyde is treated with fuming sulfuric acid ($\ce{H_2SO_4}$), the sulfonic acid group ($\ce{-SO_3H}$) is introduced at the meta position.
   
   $$ \ce{C_6H_5CHO + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow meta-C_6H_4(SO_3H)CHO} $$

3. **Halogenation of Benzaldehyde**:
   When benzaldehyde reacts with halogens ($\ce{Cl_2}$ or $\ce{Br_2}$) in the presence of a Lewis acid like iron (III) chloride ($\ce{FeCl_3}$), halogenation occurs at the meta position.
   
   $$ \ce{C_6H_5CHO + Cl_2 \rightarrow meta-C_6H_4ClCHO} $$

## Summary

Benzaldehyde undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions, but the presence of the electron-withdrawing $\ce{-CHO}$ group on the aromatic ring directs the substitution to the meta position. Common reactions include nitration, sulfonation, and halogenation, all of which predominantly occur at the meta position.

## FAQs

### 1. Why does electrophilic substitution occur at the meta position in benzaldehyde?

The formyl group ($\ce{-CHO}$) is electron-withdrawing, making the meta positions more reactive towards electrophiles than the ortho or para positions.

### 2. What is the role of the $\ce{-CHO}$ group in electrophilic substitution?

The $\ce{-CHO}$ group is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring and directs substitution to the meta position.

### 3. Can benzaldehyde undergo nitration?

Yes, benzaldehyde can undergo nitration, with the nitro group being introduced at the meta position.

### 4. How does benzaldehyde react with sulfuric acid?

Benzaldehyde reacts with sulfuric acid in a sulphonation reaction, where the sulfonic acid group is introduced at the meta position.

### 5. What happens when benzaldehyde reacts with chlorine?

When benzaldehyde reacts with chlorine, halogenation occurs at the meta position, forming a chlorobenzaldehyde.

### 6. Why is the meta position preferred in electrophilic substitution?

The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group makes the meta position more electron-deficient and thus more reactive towards electrophilic attack.

### 7. Does benzaldehyde undergo electrophilic substitution at the ortho or para positions?

No, benzaldehyde predominantly undergoes electrophilic substitution at the meta position due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the formyl group.

### 8. What is the general effect of the $\ce{-CHO}$ group on the reactivity of benzaldehyde?

The $\ce{-CHO}$ group decreases the overall reactivity of the benzene ring in electrophilic substitution but makes the meta position more reactive.

### 9. Can halogenation occur with benzaldehyde?

Yes, halogenation can occur with benzaldehyde, with the halogen being introduced at the meta position.

### 10. What is the result of sulfonation of benzaldehyde?

Sulfonation of benzaldehyde results in the introduction of a $\ce{-SO_3H}$ group at the meta position on the aromatic ring.

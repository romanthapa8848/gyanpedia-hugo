# Benzoin Condensation

The Benzoin condensation is a reaction in which two molecules of aromatic aldehydes, such as benzaldehyde, react in the presence of a cyanide ion (usually sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide) to form benzoin. The reaction proceeds via the formation of an intermediate, which undergoes nucleophilic attack to produce the final product.

---

## Reaction Mechanism

The reaction proceeds through the following steps:

1. The cyanide ion (CN$^-$) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aromatic aldehyde.
2. The attack results in the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate.
3. The intermediate undergoes rearrangement, leading to the formation of the benzoin product, which contains a hydroxyl group at the $\alpha$-position relative to the carbonyl group.

### General Reaction:

$$ \ce{2C_6H_5CHO + NaCN \rightarrow C_6H_5CHOH-C(=O)C_6H_5 + NaOH} $$

In this general reaction, two molecules of benzaldehyde ($\ce{C_6H_5CHO}$) react with sodium cyanide ($\ce{NaCN}$) to form benzoin ($\ce{C_6H_5CHOH-C(=O)C_6H_5}$).

## Example

For example, when benzaldehyde reacts with sodium cyanide in the presence of a suitable solvent, it forms benzoin.

$$ \ce{2C_6H_5CHO + NaCN \rightarrow C_6H_5CHOH-C(=O)C_6H_5} $$

## Summary

The Benzoin condensation is a useful reaction for the formation of benzoin from aromatic aldehydes. It requires a cyanide ion as a catalyst and is widely used in organic synthesis, especially for the preparation of benzoin derivatives.

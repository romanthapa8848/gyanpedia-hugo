# Formation of Alcohol, Nitrile, Amine, Ether, Thioether, Carbylamines, Nitrite, and Nitroalkane Using Haloalkanes

Haloalkanes are versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. They can be converted into various functional groups, such as alcohols, nitriles, amines, ethers, thioethers, carbylamines, nitrites, and nitroalkanes. These transformations usually involve nucleophilic substitution reactions with different reagents.

---

## 1. **Formation of Alcohols from Haloalkanes**

Haloalkanes can be converted to **alcohols** by **nucleophilic substitution** reactions with hydroxide ions ($\ce{OH^-}$).

### Reaction:
$$ \ce{RCl + OH^- → ROH + Cl^-} $$

- **Example**: Chloroethane ($\ce{C2H5Cl}$) reacts with sodium hydroxide ($\ce{NaOH}$) to form ethanol ($\ce{C2H5OH}$).

---

## 2. **Formation of Nitriles from Haloalkanes**

**Nitriles** are formed by nucleophilic substitution with cyanide ions ($\ce{CN^-}$).

### Reaction:
$$ \ce{RCl + CN^- → RCN + Cl^-} $$

- **Example**: Chloroethane reacts with sodium cyanide ($\ce{NaCN}$) to form ethyl cyanide ($\ce{C2H5CN}$).

---

## 3. **Formation of Amines from Haloalkanes**

Amines can be prepared by the reaction of haloalkanes with ammonia ($\ce{NH3}$), which results in nucleophilic substitution.

### Reaction:
$$ \ce{RCl + NH3 → RNH2 + HCl} $$

- **Example**: Chloroethane reacts with ammonia to form ethylamine ($\ce{C2H5NH2}$).

---

## 4. **Formation of Ethers from Haloalkanes**

Ethers are formed by the reaction of haloalkanes with alkoxides ($\ce{RO^-}$), which leads to nucleophilic substitution.

### Reaction:
$$ \ce{RCl + RO^- → ROR + Cl^-} $$

- **Example**: Chloroethane reacts with sodium ethoxide ($\ce{C2H5O^-}$) to form ethoxyethane (diethyl ether, $\ce{C2H5OC2H5}$).

---

## 5. **Formation of Thioethers from Haloalkanes**

**Thioethers** are formed by nucleophilic substitution with thiolate ions ($\ce{RSH^-}$).

### Reaction:
$$ \ce{RCl + RSH^- → RSR + Cl^-} $$

- **Example**: Chloroethane reacts with sodium mercaptide ($\ce{C2H5SH}$) to form ethyl ethyl sulfide ($\ce{C2H5SC2H5}$).

---

## 6. **Formation of Carbylamines from Haloalkanes**

**Carbylamines** are formed by the reaction of haloalkanes with ammonia ($\ce{NH3}$) in the presence of an alcohol, resulting in the formation of isocyanides (carbylamines).

### Reaction:
$$ \ce{RCl + NH3 → RNC + HCl} $$

- **Example**: Chloroethane reacts with ammonia to form **ethyl isocyanide** ($\ce{C2H5NC}$).

---

## 7. **Formation of Nitrites from Haloalkanes**

**Nitrites** are formed by the nucleophilic substitution of haloalkanes with nitrite ions ($\ce{NO2^-}$).

### Reaction:
$$ \ce{RCl + NO2^- → RNO2 + Cl^-} $$

- **Example**: Chloroethane reacts with sodium nitrite ($\ce{NaNO2}$) to form ethyl nitrite ($\ce{C2H5NO2}$).

---

## 8. **Formation of Nitroalkanes from Haloalkanes**

**Nitroalkanes** are formed by the reaction of haloalkanes with sodium nitrite ($\ce{NaNO2}$) in the presence of a base, typically under an alkaline medium.

### Reaction:
$$ \ce{RCl + NaNO2 → RNO2 + NaCl} $$

- **Example**: Chloroethane reacts with sodium nitrite to form nitroethane ($\ce{C2H5NO2}$).

---

## Summary

Haloalkanes undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions with various nucleophiles to form a variety of organic compounds:
- **Alcohols** from $\ce{OH^-}$.
- **Nitriles** from $\ce{CN^-}$.
- **Amines** from $\ce{NH3}$.
- **Ethers** from alkoxide ions ($\ce{RO^-}$).
- **Thioethers** from thiolate ions ($\ce{RSH^-}$).
- **Carbylamines** from $\ce{NH3}$.
- **Nitrites** from $\ce{NO2^-}$.
- **Nitroalkanes** from $\ce{NaNO2}$.

These transformations provide a broad range of organic compounds from a simple halogenated starting material.

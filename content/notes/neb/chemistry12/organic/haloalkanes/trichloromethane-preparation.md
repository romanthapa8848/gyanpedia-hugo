# Preparation of Trichloromethane from Ethanol and Propanone

Trichloromethane, commonly known as **chloroform**, is a useful solvent and is prepared by chlorination reactions. It can be synthesized from ethanol or propanone through a process involving halogenation.

## 1. **Preparation from Ethanol**

Ethanol can be converted to chloroform by reacting it with chlorine gas ($\ce{Cl2}$) in the presence of an oxidizing agent. The reaction proceeds through a series of halogenation steps, where ethanol first undergoes oxidation, and subsequently, chlorine reacts with the intermediate compound to produce chloroform.

### Reaction:

$$ \ce{CH3CH2OH + 3Cl2 → CHCl3 + 3HCl + 2H2O} $$

In this reaction:
- Ethanol ($\ce{CH3CH2OH}$) reacts with chlorine ($\ce{Cl2}$).
- Trichloromethane ($\ce{CHCl3}$, chloroform) is formed.
- Hydrochloric acid ($\ce{HCl}$) and water ($\ce{H2O}$) are also produced.

## 2. **Preparation from Propanone**

Propanone (acetone) can be chlorinated to form trichloromethane under similar conditions. The reaction occurs when acetone is treated with chlorine gas, which leads to the formation of chloroform. The process also involves the formation of an intermediate trichloromethyl compound.

### Reaction:

$$ \ce{CH3COCH3 + 3Cl2 → CHCl3 + 3HCl} $$

In this reaction:
- Propanone ($\ce{CH3COCH3}$) reacts with chlorine ($\ce{Cl2}$).
- Chloroform ($\ce{CHCl3}$) is produced.
- Hydrochloric acid ($\ce{HCl}$) is also a byproduct.

## Summary

- **Ethanol to Chloroform**: Ethanol reacts with chlorine in the presence of an oxidizing agent to form chloroform, along with the byproducts $\ce{HCl}$ and $\ce{H2O}$.
- **Propanone to Chloroform**: Propanone undergoes chlorination with chlorine to produce chloroform and $\ce{HCl}$.

# Tests of Phenol: FeCl₃ Test, Aqueous Bromine Test & Libermann Test

Phenol can be identified through various simple chemical tests. These tests involve the reaction of phenol with certain reagents that lead to the formation of characteristic products. Here, we discuss three common tests: the **FeCl₃ test**, the **aqueous bromine test**, and the **Libermann test**.

### 1. **FeCl₃ Test (Ferric Chloride Test)**

The FeCl₃ test is a simple test for phenols based on the formation of a colored complex with ferric chloride ($\ce{FeCl_3}$). When phenol reacts with ferric chloride solution, it forms a violet or purple complex. This reaction occurs due to the phenolic group ($\ce{-OH}$) that can donate electrons to the iron ion, forming the colored complex.

**Reaction:**
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + FeCl_3 \rightarrow [C_6H_5OH-FeCl_3]}$$

The formation of a violet color confirms the presence of phenol.

### 2. **Aqueous Bromine Test**

Phenol reacts with bromine water ($\ce{Br_2(aq)}$) to form a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol. This test is used to distinguish phenol from other aromatic compounds. The reaction takes place at room temperature, and the phenol acts as an electrophilic aromatic substitution agent, displacing the bromine atoms at the ortho and para positions.

**Reaction:**
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + 3Br_2 \rightarrow C_6H_2Br_3OH + 3HBr}$$

The appearance of a white precipitate confirms the presence of phenol.

### 3. **Libermann Test**

The Libermann test is used to detect phenolic compounds. In this test, phenol reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid ($\ce{H_2SO_4}$) and a small amount of nitric acid ($\ce{HNO_3}$). The reaction produces a blue or green color, indicating the presence of phenol.

**Reaction:**
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + H_2SO_4 + HNO_3 \rightarrow [C_6H_5OH-HNO_3-H_2SO_4]}$$

The appearance of a blue or green color indicates a positive result for phenol.

## Summary

Phenol can be identified by several characteristic tests:
- **FeCl₃ test**: A violet color is formed when phenol reacts with ferric chloride.
- **Aqueous bromine test**: A white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol forms when phenol reacts with aqueous bromine.
- **Libermann test**: A blue or green color appears when phenol reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid.

These tests are simple and widely used to confirm the presence of phenol.

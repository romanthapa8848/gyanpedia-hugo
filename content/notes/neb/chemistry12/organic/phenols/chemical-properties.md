# Chemical Properties of Phenol

Phenol exhibits unique chemical properties due to the presence of both a hydroxyl group ($\ce{-OH}$) and an aromatic ring ($\ce{C6H5}$). These properties make phenol reactive in a variety of ways, including acidic behavior, electrophilic substitution reactions, and oxidation.

### 1. **Acidic Nature**
Phenol is weakly acidic due to the ability of the hydroxyl group to donate a proton ($\ce{H+}$), forming a phenoxide ion ($\ce{C6H5O^-}$). The phenoxide ion is resonance-stabilized, which accounts for phenol’s acidity.

- Reaction with sodium hydroxide:
  $$\ce{C6H5OH + NaOH -> C6H5ONa + H2O}$$

- Reaction with sodium metal:
  $$\ce{2C6H5OH + 2Na -> 2C6H5ONa + H2}$$

### 2. **Electrophilic Substitution Reactions**
Phenol undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions due to the activating effect of the hydroxyl group, which increases the electron density of the benzene ring.

#### a) Nitration
Phenol reacts with dilute nitric acid to give ortho- and para-nitrophenols.

$$\ce{C6H5OH + HNO3 -> o-C6H4(NO2)OH + p-C6H4(NO2)OH}$$

#### b) Bromination
Phenol reacts with bromine water to form 2,4,6-tribromophenol.

$$\ce{C6H5OH + 3Br2 -> C6H2Br3OH + 3HBr}$$

#### c) Sulfonation
Phenol reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid to form ortho- and para-phenolsulfonic acids.

$$\ce{C6H5OH + H2SO4 -> o-C6H4(OH)(SO3H) + p-C6H4(OH)(SO3H)}$$

### 3. **Reactions with Oxidizing Agents**
Phenol is oxidized by strong oxidizing agents to form quinone.

$$\ce{C6H5OH + [O] -> C6H4O2}$$

### 4. **Reaction with Zinc Dust**
When heated with zinc dust, phenol is reduced to benzene.

$$\ce{C6H5OH + Zn -> C6H6 + ZnO}$$

### 5. **Esterification**
Phenol reacts with acid anhydrides or acid chlorides to form esters.

$$\ce{C6H5OH + CH3COCl -> C6H5OCOCH3 + HCl}$$

## Summary

Phenol exhibits chemical properties due to its $\ce{-OH}$ group and aromatic ring. It behaves as a weak acid, undergoing neutralization reactions with bases and metals. Phenol readily participates in electrophilic substitution reactions such as nitration, bromination, and sulfonation. It can also undergo oxidation to form quinone, reduction to benzene, and esterification to form esters.

## FAQs

### 1. Why is phenol acidic?
Phenol is acidic because the hydroxyl group can donate a proton ($\ce{H+}$), forming a resonance-stabilized phenoxide ion.

### 2. What happens when phenol reacts with bromine water?
Phenol reacts with bromine water to form 2,4,6-tribromophenol, which precipitates as a white solid.

### 3. What are the products of the nitration of phenol?
Nitration of phenol produces ortho-nitrophenol and para-nitrophenol.

### 4. How does phenol react with concentrated sulfuric acid?
Phenol reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid to form ortho- and para-phenolsulfonic acids.

### 5. What happens when phenol is oxidized?
Phenol is oxidized to quinone by strong oxidizing agents.

### 6. Can phenol form esters?
Yes, phenol reacts with acid anhydrides or acid chlorides to form esters.

### 7. How does zinc dust affect phenol?
Phenol is reduced to benzene when heated with zinc dust.

### 8. Why does phenol undergo electrophilic substitution reactions easily?
The $\ce{-OH}$ group increases the electron density of the benzene ring, making it more reactive towards electrophiles.

### 9. What is the product of phenol and sodium hydroxide reaction?
Phenol reacts with sodium hydroxide to form sodium phenoxide and water.

### 10. Is phenol a strong or weak acid?
Phenol is a weak acid, with a pKa value of approximately 9.95.

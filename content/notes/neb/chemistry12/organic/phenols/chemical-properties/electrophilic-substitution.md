# Electrophilic Substitution: Nitration, Sulphonation, Bromination, and Friedel-Craft's Alkylation

Electrophilic substitution reactions of phenol involve the substitution of a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring by an electrophile. Phenol, due to its activating effect on the benzene ring, undergoes these reactions more readily than benzene itself. The key electrophilic substitution reactions of phenol are nitration, sulphonation, bromination, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

### 1. **Nitration**
Nitration is the introduction of a nitro group ($\ce{NO_2}$) to the aromatic ring. In this reaction, phenol reacts with a nitrating mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid ($\ce{H_2SO_4}$) and concentrated nitric acid ($\ce{HNO_3}$) to form nitrophenol.

The general reaction is:
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + HNO_3 \xrightarrow{H_2SO_4} C_6H_4(OH)(NO_2)}$$

In phenol, the hydroxyl group ($\ce{OH}$) activates the ring, and the nitro group typically enters the **ortho** or **para** positions relative to the hydroxyl group. The product is mostly **2-nitrophenol** and **4-nitrophenol**.

### 2. **Sulphonation**
Sulphonation involves the substitution of a hydrogen atom with a sulfonic acid group ($\ce{SO_3H}$). In the presence of fuming sulfuric acid ($\ce{H_2SO_4}$) or oleum, phenol undergoes sulphonation to form phenolsulfonic acid.

The general reaction is:
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow C_6H_4(OH)(SO_3H)}$$

The sulfonic acid group is typically introduced in the **ortho** or **para** positions relative to the hydroxyl group due to the activating effect of the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring.

### 3. **Bromination**
Bromination of phenol occurs readily without the need for a catalyst, unlike benzene. The hydroxyl group activates the aromatic ring, allowing bromine ($\ce{Br_2}$) to react and substitute a hydrogen atom, forming bromophenol.

The general reaction is:
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + Br_2 \rightarrow C_6H_4(OH)(Br) + HBr}$$

The bromine atom is typically introduced in the **ortho** or **para** positions relative to the hydroxyl group. The products are usually **2-bromophenol** and **4-bromophenol**.

### 4. **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**
Friedel-Crafts alkylation is the substitution of a hydrogen atom with an alkyl group ($\ce{R}$) using an alkyl halide ($\ce{RCl}$) and a Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminum chloride ($\ce{AlCl_3}$). In phenol, the hydroxyl group activates the ring, facilitating the alkylation reaction.

The general reaction is:
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + RCl \xrightarrow{AlCl_3} C_6H_4(OH)(R) + HCl}$$

This reaction introduces an alkyl group, typically in the **para** position relative to the hydroxyl group.

## Summary

Phenol undergoes various electrophilic substitution reactions due to the activating influence of the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring. These include:
- **Nitration**, where a nitro group is introduced.
- **Sulphonation**, where a sulfonic acid group is introduced.
- **Bromination**, where a bromine atom is introduced.
- **Friedel-Crafts alkylation**, where an alkyl group is introduced.

These reactions are useful in modifying phenol to synthesize a wide range of aromatic compounds with varying functional groups.

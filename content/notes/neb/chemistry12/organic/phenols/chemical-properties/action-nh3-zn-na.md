# Action with NH₃, Zn, Na, Benzene Diazonium Chloride, and Phthalic Anhydride

Phenol undergoes various reactions with different reagents, each showing unique chemical properties. The reactions with ammonia (NH₃), zinc (Zn), sodium (Na), benzene diazonium chloride, and phthalic anhydride play an essential role in the preparation of various compounds.

### 1. **Reaction with Ammonia (NH₃)**
When phenol reacts with ammonia, it undergoes a substitution reaction, forming an amide group. This reaction occurs under basic conditions:
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + NH_3 \rightarrow C_6H_5NH_2 + H_2O}$$
This reaction forms aniline, which is an important starting material in the preparation of dyes, drugs, and other organic compounds.

### 2. **Reaction with Zinc (Zn)**
Phenol reacts with zinc metal in the presence of heat to form cyclohexadiene derivatives. This is an example of a reduction reaction:
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + Zn \rightarrow C_6H_6 + ZnO}$$
In this reaction, phenol is reduced to benzene by zinc, and zinc oxide (\ce{ZnO}) is formed as a byproduct.

### 3. **Reaction with Sodium (Na)**
Phenol reacts with sodium to form sodium phenoxide and hydrogen gas. The reaction proceeds as:
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + Na \rightarrow C_6H_5ONa + H_2}$$
This reaction is an example of an acid-base reaction, where phenol donates a proton to form the phenoxide ion (\ce{C_6H_5O^-}) and hydrogen gas is released.

### 4. **Reaction with Benzene Diazonium Chloride**
Phenol undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution with benzene diazonium chloride. The hydroxyl group in phenol is an activating group that increases the reactivity of the aromatic ring:
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + C_6H_5N_2^+Cl^- \rightarrow C_6H_4(OH)(C_6H_4N_2^+) + HCl}$$
This reaction leads to the formation of azo compounds, which are used in dye synthesis.

### 5. **Reaction with Phthalic Anhydride**
Phenol reacts with phthalic anhydride to form esters. The reaction proceeds as follows:
$$\ce{C_6H_5OH + (C_6H_4CO)_2O \rightarrow C_6H_4(COOC_6H_5)_2 + H_2O}$$
This esterification reaction produces phenyl phthalate, which is used as a plasticizer in the manufacturing of plastics.

# Action with Na: Fittig and Wurtz-Fittig Reactions

The reactions of haloarenes with sodium are important organic reactions that form carbon-carbon bonds. Two notable reactions that involve sodium are the **Fittig reaction** and the **Wurtz-Fittig reaction**. Both reactions involve the coupling of aryl halides but differ in their types of coupling.

## 1. **Fittig Reaction**

The Fittig reaction is a coupling reaction of **aryl halides** with **sodium** in the presence of dry **ether** to form **biaryl** compounds (two aromatic rings connected by a single bond).

### Mechanism:
1. **Formation of Aryl Radicals**: The sodium metal donates electrons to the halogen atom, leading to the formation of an aryl radical or an aryl anion.
2. **Coupling**: The two aryl radicals couple together to form a new **C-C bond**, resulting in a **biaryl** compound.

### Reaction:
$$ C_6H_5Cl + C_6H_5Na \xrightarrow{Na, \, \text{ether}} C_6H_5-C_6H_5 $$

Here, phenyl chloride reacts with sodium to produce biphenyl.

### Products:
- **Biaryl Compounds** (for example, biphenyl)

## 2. **Wurtz-Fittig Reaction**

The Wurtz-Fittig reaction is a combination of the **Wurtz reaction** and the **Fittig reaction**. It involves the coupling of **alkyl halides** with **aryl halides** in the presence of **sodium** metal. The reaction produces a **biaryl** compound with an alkyl group attached to one of the rings.

### Mechanism:
1. **Formation of Aryl and Alkyl Radicals**: Sodium donates electrons to both the aryl and alkyl halides, leading to the formation of aryl and alkyl radicals or anions.
2. **Coupling**: The aryl and alkyl radicals then couple together, forming a new **C-C bond**, resulting in an **alkylated biaryl**.

### Reaction:
$$ C_6H_5Cl + C_2H_5Cl \xrightarrow{Na, \, \text{ether}} C_6H_5-C_2H_5 $$

Here, phenyl chloride reacts with ethyl chloride to produce **ethylbenzene** (C₆H₅C₂H₅).

### Products:
- **Alkylated Biaryl Compounds** (e.g., ethylbenzene)

## Summary

The **Fittig reaction** is the coupling of two **aryl halides** using sodium to form **biaryl** compounds, while the **Wurtz-Fittig reaction** involves the coupling of **alkyl halides** with **aryl halides** to produce **alkylated biaryl compounds**. Both reactions are valuable methods for synthesizing aromatic compounds with a carbon-carbon bond between rings.

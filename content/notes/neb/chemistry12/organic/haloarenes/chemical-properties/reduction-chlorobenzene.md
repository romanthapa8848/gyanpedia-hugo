# Reduction of Chlorobenzene

Chlorobenzene can undergo reduction reactions to form different products, depending on the reducing agent used. These reactions typically involve the addition of hydrogen (H₂) or the use of other reducing agents in the presence of a catalyst.

## Methods of Reduction

### 1. **Hydrogenation with Hydrogen and Catalyst**
Chlorobenzene can be reduced to **cyclohexane** by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst, such as **nickel (Ni)** or **platinum (Pt)**. This is an example of a **reduction of an aromatic compound** to a saturated compound.

- **Reaction**:  
  $$ C_6H_5Cl + 3H_2 \xrightarrow{Ni/Pt} C_6H_{12} + HCl $$

- In this reaction, the hydrogen atoms add to the benzene ring, replacing the chlorine atom with hydrogen, resulting in **cyclohexane**.

### 2. **Reduction Using Sodium in Dry Ether (Wurtz Reaction)**
Chlorobenzene can also undergo reduction using **sodium** metal in **dry ether**. This reaction is known as the **Wurtz reaction** and leads to the formation of **biphenyl**.

- **Reaction**:  
  $$ 2C_6H_5Cl + 2Na \xrightarrow{dry \, ether} C_6H_5-C_6H_5 + 2NaCl $$

- In this reaction, **chlorobenzene** is reduced to **biphenyl** through the exchange of chlorine atoms with sodium atoms, forming a new C-C bond between two phenyl groups.

### 3. **Reduction Using Tin and Hydrochloric Acid**
Chlorobenzene can be reduced to **phenylamine** (aniline) by using **tin (Sn)** in the presence of **hydrochloric acid (HCl)**. This is an example of a **reductive amination** reaction.

- **Reaction**:  
  $$ C_6H_5Cl + 3Sn + 6HCl \xrightarrow{} C_6H_5NH_2 + 3SnCl_2 $$

- The chlorine atom is replaced by an **amino group (NH₂)**, forming **aniline**.

### 4. **Reduction Using Iron and Hydrochloric Acid**
Chlorobenzene can also be reduced to **aniline** by **iron (Fe)** in **hydrochloric acid (HCl)**. This is another method for the preparation of aniline from chlorobenzene.

- **Reaction**:  
  $$ C_6H_5Cl + 6Fe + 6HCl \xrightarrow{} C_6H_5NH_2 + 6FeCl_2 $$

- In this reaction, **iron** serves as the reducing agent, replacing the chlorine atom with an **amino group**, forming **aniline**.

## Summary

Chlorobenzene can be reduced using various methods depending on the desired product. Some common methods include hydrogenation with a catalyst to form **cyclohexane**, the **Wurtz reaction** to form **biphenyl**, and the use of **tin and hydrochloric acid** or **iron and hydrochloric acid** to reduce it to **aniline**.

### 8. How is aniline prepared from chlorobenzene?  
Aniline is prepared by reducing chlorobenzene using tin and hydrochloric acid or iron and hydrochloric acid.

### 9. Can the Wurtz reaction be used for other aromatic compounds besides chlorobenzene?  
Yes, the Wurtz reaction can be used for other halogenated aromatic compounds to form biphenyl.

### 10. What type of reaction is the hydrogenation of chlorobenzene?  
The hydrogenation of chlorobenzene is a reduction reaction where the hydrogen atoms add to the benzene ring.

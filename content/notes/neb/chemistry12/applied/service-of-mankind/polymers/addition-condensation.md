# Addition and Condensation Polymers

Polymers are large molecules made up of repeating structural units called monomers. They play a significant role in various industries, from packaging materials to medical devices. Based on the method of polymerization, polymers can be classified into two broad categories: addition polymers and condensation polymers.

## Addition Polymers

Addition polymers are formed by the addition of monomer units with a double bond or a ring structure. The polymerization process involves the opening of the double bond or ring, allowing monomer molecules to add one by one to form long chains. These polymers do not release any by-products during their formation.

### Examples:
- **Polyethylene (PE)**: Formed by the polymerization of ethylene (C₂H₄) molecules.
- **Polystyrene (PS)**: Formed by the polymerization of styrene (C₆H₅CH=CH₂).
- **Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)**: Formed by the polymerization of vinyl chloride (C₂H₃Cl).

These addition polymers are commonly used in packaging materials, plastic containers, pipes, and insulation.

## Condensation Polymers

Condensation polymers are formed by the polymerization of monomers that contain two or more functional groups, typically with the elimination of small molecules such as water, alcohol, or hydrogen chloride. This type of polymerization results in a reduction in the number of monomer units and leads to the formation of a long chain polymer.

### Examples:
- **Nylon (Polyamide)**: Formed by the condensation of hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid.
- **Terylene (Polyester)**: Formed by the condensation of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.
- **Bakelite**: A thermosetting resin formed by the condensation of phenol and formaldehyde.

Condensation polymers are widely used in fibers, textiles, films, and engineering plastics.

| **Functional Groups**          | Monomers with unsaturated bonds                 | Monomers with two or more functional groups    |
| **Application**                | Packaging, insulation, plastic containers       | Textiles, fibers, engineering plastics         |

## Summary

Addition and condensation polymers are two major classes of synthetic polymers. Addition polymers are formed by adding monomers with unsaturated bonds, whereas condensation polymers are created by the elimination of small molecules during the polymerization of monomers. Both types of polymers have vast industrial applications, from packaging materials to clothing and engineering plastics.

The by-products of condensation polymerization can include water, alcohol, or other small molecules depending on the type of reaction.

### 5. Is nylon a condensation polymer?
Yes, nylon is a condensation polymer formed by the reaction between hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid.

### 6. What is Terylene made from?
Terylene is made from the condensation polymerization of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.

### 7. Can addition polymers be recycled?
Yes, addition polymers like polyethylene and polypropylene can be recycled, though the process may vary depending on the type of polymer.

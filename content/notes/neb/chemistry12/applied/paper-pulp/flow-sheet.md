# Paper and Pulp: Introduction

The paper and pulp industry plays a crucial role in modern society by providing essential materials for communication, education, and packaging. Paper is made primarily from cellulose fibers, obtained from wood, agricultural residues, or recycled materials. The process of producing paper involves converting raw materials into pulp, which is then processed and dried to form sheets.

The industry is vital for both economic development and environmental sustainability. While paper serves numerous applications, its production must address environmental concerns such as deforestation and pollution.

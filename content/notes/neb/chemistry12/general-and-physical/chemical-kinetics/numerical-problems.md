# Solving Related Numerical Problems Based on Rate, Rate Constant, and Order of Zero and First-Order Reactions

In this section, we will focus on solving numerical problems related to the rate of reactions, rate constant, and order of zero and first-order reactions. These problems involve understanding the mathematical expressions that describe reaction rates, as well as applying the integrated rate equations for zero and first-order reactions to calculate quantities such as concentration, time, and rate constant.

### Zero-Order Reactions

For a **zero-order reaction**, the rate of reaction is independent of the concentration of the reactant. The rate law is given by:

$$ \text{Rate} = k $$

The integrated rate law for a zero-order reaction is:

$$ [A] = [A_0] - kt $$

where:
- $[A]$ = concentration of reactant at time $t$
- $[A_0]$ = initial concentration of reactant
- $k$ = rate constant
- $t$ = time

The half-life ($t_{1/2}$) for a zero-order reaction is given by:

$$ t_{1/2} = \frac{[A_0]}{2k} $$

### First-Order Reactions

For a **first-order reaction**, the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant. The rate law is given by:

$$ \text{Rate} = k[A] $$

The integrated rate law for a first-order reaction is:

$$ \ln\left(\frac{[A_0]}{[A]}\right) = kt $$

where:
- $[A]$ = concentration of reactant at time $t$
- $[A_0]$ = initial concentration of reactant
- $k$ = rate constant
- $t$ = time

The half-life ($t_{1/2}$) for a first-order reaction is given by:

$$ t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{k} $$

## Numerical Examples

1. **Zero-Order Reaction Example**:

   The decomposition of a compound follows a zero-order reaction. The initial concentration of the compound is $0.2 \, \text{mol/L}$, and the rate constant is $0.1 \, \text{mol/L/s}$. Calculate the concentration of the compound after 5 seconds.

   - Given:
     - $[A_0] = 0.2 \, \text{mol/L}$
     - $k = 0.1 \, \text{mol/L/s}$
     - $t = 5 \, \text{s}$

   - Using the integrated rate law for a zero-order reaction:

     $$ [A] = [A_0] - kt $$

     $$ [A] = 0.2 - (0.1 \times 5) $$

     $$ [A] = 0.2 - 0.5 $$

     $$ [A] = -0.3 \, \text{mol/L} $$

     Since concentration cannot be negative, the reaction has gone to completion, and all the reactant has been consumed. The concentration is zero.

2. **First-Order Reaction Example**:

   The rate constant for a first-order reaction is $0.02 \, \text{s}^{-1}$. If the initial concentration of the reactant is $0.5 \, \text{mol/L}$, calculate the concentration of the reactant after 30 seconds.

   - Given:
     - $[A_0] = 0.5 \, \text{mol/L}$
     - $k = 0.02 \, \text{s}^{-1}$
     - $t = 30 \, \text{s}$

   - Using the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction:

     $$ \ln\left(\frac{[A_0]}{[A]}\right) = kt $$

     $$ \ln\left(\frac{0.5}{[A]}\right) = 0.02 \times 30 $$

     $$ \ln\left(\frac{0.5}{[A]}\right) = 0.6 $$

     Taking the exponential of both sides:

     $$ \frac{0.5}{[A]} = e^{0.6} $$

     $$ \frac{0.5}{[A]} = 1.822 $$

     $$ [A] = \frac{0.5}{1.822} $$

     $$ [A] = 0.274 \, \text{mol/L} $$

   The concentration of the reactant after 30 seconds is $0.274 \, \text{mol/L}$.

## Summary

- **Zero-order reactions** have a rate that is independent of the concentration of the reactant, and their integrated rate law is linear.
- **First-order reactions** have a rate proportional to the concentration of the reactant, and their integrated rate law involves a logarithmic relationship.
- The **half-life** of a zero-order reaction depends on the initial concentration and rate constant, while the **half-life** of a first-order reaction is constant and independent of the initial concentration.

## FAQs

### 1. How do you calculate the rate constant for a zero-order reaction?

For a zero-order reaction, you can use the equation $[A] = [A_0] - kt$ to calculate the rate constant $k$ if you know the initial concentration, the concentration at a specific time, and the time elapsed.

### 2. What is the relationship between half-life and concentration in a zero-order reaction?

In a zero-order reaction, the half-life is directly proportional to the initial concentration: $$ t_{1/2} = \frac{[A_0]}{2k} $$

### 3. What is the formula for the half-life of a first-order reaction?

For a first-order reaction, the half-life is independent of the initial concentration and is given by: $$ t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{k} $$

### 4. What does the rate constant $k$ represent in a reaction?

The rate constant $k$ represents the proportionality constant in the rate law equation, and it depends on factors such as temperature and the nature of the reaction.

### 5. Can the rate constant change over time?

Yes, the rate constant can change with temperature, as it is related to the activation energy and temperature (as shown by the Arrhenius equation).

### 6. How do you determine the order of a reaction?

The order of a reaction can be determined by experimental data, often by examining how the rate of reaction changes with different concentrations of reactants.

### 7. What happens if a zero-order reaction reaches completion?

In a zero-order reaction, once the reactant is fully consumed, the concentration reaches zero, and no further reaction occurs.

### 8. How does the concentration change in a first-order reaction?

In a first-order reaction, the concentration of the reactant decreases exponentially over time.

### 9. Is the rate constant affected by the concentration of reactants?

No, the rate constant is independent of the concentration of reactants but is affected by factors such as temperature.

### 10. How is the integrated rate law for zero-order and first-order reactions used in solving problems?

The integrated rate laws for zero-order and first-order reactions allow you to calculate the concentration of reactants at any given time, based on the initial concentration and rate constant.

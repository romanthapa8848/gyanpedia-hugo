# Relationship Between $\Delta G$ and Equilibrium Constant (Solving Related Numerical Problems)

The relationship between the change in Gibbs' free energy ($\Delta G$) and the equilibrium constant ($K$) of a chemical reaction can be expressed using the following equation:

$$
\Delta G = -RT \ln K
$$

Where:
- $\Delta G$ is the change in Gibbs free energy,
- $R$ is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K),
- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin,
- $K$ is the equilibrium constant.

This equation allows us to predict the spontaneity of a reaction at equilibrium based on the value of $K$:
- If $K > 1$, the reaction favors the formation of products, and $\Delta G$ is negative (spontaneous).
- If $K < 1$, the reaction favors the reactants, and $\Delta G$ is positive (non-spontaneous).
- If $K = 1$, the system is at equilibrium, and $\Delta G = 0$.

### Solving Related Numerical Problems:

#### **Problem 1**: Given that the standard Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G^\circ$) for a reaction is -150 kJ/mol at 298 K, calculate the equilibrium constant ($K$) at this temperature.

**Solution**:

We use the equation:

$$
\Delta G = -RT \ln K
$$

Rearranging to find $K$:

$$
K = e^{-\frac{\Delta G^\circ}{RT}}
$$

Substituting the values:
- $\Delta G^\circ = -150 \, \text{kJ/mol} = -150,000 \, \text{J/mol}$ (since 1 kJ = 1000 J),
- $R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}$,
- $T = 298 \, \text{K}$.

Now, calculating $K$:

$$
K = e^{-\frac{-150,000}{8.314 \times 298}}
$$

$$
K = e^{60.43}
$$

$$
K \approx 4.24 \times 10^{26}
$$

So, the equilibrium constant ($K$) is approximately $4.24 \times 10^{26}$.

#### **Problem 2**: If the equilibrium constant for a reaction is 10 at 298 K, calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G^\circ$).

**Solution**:

We use the equation:

$$
\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K
$$

Substituting the values:
- $K = 10$,
- $R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}$,
- $T = 298 \, \text{K}$.

Now, calculating $\Delta G^\circ$:

$$
\Delta G^\circ = -8.314 \times 298 \times \ln(10)
$$

$$
\Delta G^\circ = -8.314 \times 298 \times 2.3026
$$

$$
\Delta G^\circ \approx -5737.7 \, \text{J/mol} = -5.74 \, \text{kJ/mol}
$$

So, the standard Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G^\circ$) is approximately $-5.74 \, \text{kJ/mol}$.

#### **Problem 3**: For a reaction with $\Delta G^\circ = 100 \, \text{kJ/mol}$ at 350 K, find the equilibrium constant.

**Solution**:

We use the equation:

$$
\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K
$$

Rearranging to solve for $K$:

$$
K = e^{-\frac{\Delta G^\circ}{RT}}
$$

Substituting the values:
- $\Delta G^\circ = 100 \, \text{kJ/mol} = 100,000 \, \text{J/mol}$,
- $R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}$,
- $T = 350 \, \text{K}$.

Now, calculating $K$:

$$
K = e^{-\frac{100,000}{8.314 \times 350}}
$$

$$
K = e^{-34.22}
$$

$$
K \approx 2.8 \times 10^{-16}
$$

So, the equilibrium constant ($K$) is approximately $2.8 \times 10^{-16}$.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the relationship between $\Delta G$ and the equilibrium constant?

The change in Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G$) is related to the equilibrium constant ($K$) by the equation: $$\Delta G = -RT \ln K$$. This shows how the spontaneity of a reaction is connected to its equilibrium position.

### 2. What does a positive $\Delta G$ indicate in relation to the equilibrium constant?

A positive $\Delta G$ indicates that the reaction favors the reactants, and the equilibrium constant ($K$) will be less than 1.

### 3. What happens when $K > 1$?

When $K > 1$, the reaction favors the products, and $\Delta G$ is negative, indicating that the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions.

### 4. How is the equilibrium constant related to the spontaneity of a reaction?

The equilibrium constant indicates the relative concentrations of products and reactants at equilibrium. A large $K$ means the reaction goes mostly toward products, and a negative $\Delta G$ suggests the reaction is spontaneous.

### 5. What does $\Delta G = 0$ mean?

When $\Delta G = 0$, the system is at equilibrium, meaning the concentrations of reactants and products no longer change.

### 6. Can $\Delta G$ be used to predict the equilibrium constant?

Yes, $\Delta G$ is used to predict the equilibrium constant. A negative $\Delta G$ corresponds to a large $K$, indicating that products are favored at equilibrium.

### 7. What is the significance of the value of $K$?

The equilibrium constant ($K$) tells us how far a reaction will proceed toward products or reactants at equilibrium. Large $K$ means the reaction goes mostly toward products, and small $K$ means it favors reactants.

### 8. How does temperature affect the equilibrium constant?

The equilibrium constant depends on temperature. Higher temperatures can increase or decrease $K$ depending on whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic.

### 9. Can $\Delta G$ be positive and $K$ be greater than 1?

No, if $K > 1$, $\Delta G$ must be negative, indicating a spontaneous reaction.

### 10. How do we calculate the equilibrium constant at non-standard temperatures?

At non-standard temperatures, the equation $\Delta G = -RT \ln K$ is used, and the temperature ($T$) must be in Kelvin to calculate the equilibrium constant at that specific temperature.

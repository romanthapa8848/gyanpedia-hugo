# Lewis Definition of Acids and Bases
The Lewis definition of acids and bases is based on the concept of electron pairs. Unlike the Brønsted-Lowry theory, which defines acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors, the Lewis theory defines acids and bases in terms of **electron pair donation** and **acceptance**.

- A **Lewis acid** is a substance that **accepts an electron pair** from a Lewis base to form a coordinate bond.
- A **Lewis base** is a substance that **donates an electron pair** to a Lewis acid to form a coordinate bond.

### Examples of Lewis Acids and Bases:
1. **$BF_3$ (boron trifluoride)** is a Lewis acid because boron has an empty orbital and can accept an electron pair.
2. **$NH_3$ (ammonia)** is a Lewis base because nitrogen has a lone pair of electrons that it can donate to a Lewis acid.

For instance:
- When $NH_3$ donates its lone pair of electrons to $BF_3$, they form a coordinate bond, resulting in the complex **$NH_3$-$BF_3$**.
  $$
  NH_3 + BF_3 \rightarrow NH_3-BF_3
  $$

In this example, **$NH_3$** acts as a Lewis base, and **$BF_3$** acts as a Lewis acid.

This definition is more general and can explain acid-base reactions that do not involve proton transfer, such as those that occur in metal-ligand complexes.

## Summary
The Lewis definition of acids and bases is based on electron pair donation and acceptance. A Lewis acid accepts an electron pair, while a Lewis base donates an electron pair. This theory provides a broader understanding of acid-base interactions, including those without proton transfer.

## FAQs

### 1. What is a Lewis acid?
A Lewis acid is a substance that accepts an electron pair from a Lewis base to form a coordinate bond.

### 2. What is a Lewis base?
A Lewis base is a substance that donates an electron pair to a Lewis acid to form a coordinate bond.

### 3. Can a molecule be both a Lewis acid and a Lewis base?
Yes, some molecules can act as both a Lewis acid and a Lewis base depending on the reaction. For example, water ($H_2O$) can act as a Lewis base or acid.

### 4. How is the Lewis theory different from the Brønsted-Lowry theory?
The Lewis theory defines acids and bases in terms of electron pair donation and acceptance, while the Brønsted-Lowry theory defines acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors.

### 5. What is an example of a Lewis acid?
An example of a Lewis acid is **$BF_3$** (boron trifluoride), which can accept an electron pair from a Lewis base.

### 6. What is an example of a Lewis base?
An example of a Lewis base is **$NH_3$** (ammonia), which can donate a lone pair of electrons to a Lewis acid.

### 7. How do coordinate bonds relate to Lewis acids and bases?
A coordinate bond is formed when a Lewis base donates an electron pair to a Lewis acid, creating a new bond between the two species.

### 8. Can you give an example of a Lewis acid-base reaction?
An example is the reaction between **$NH_3$** and **$BF_3$** to form the complex **$NH_3$-$BF_3$**.

### 9. What is the significance of the Lewis acid-base theory?
The Lewis acid-base theory broadens the concept of acid-base reactions to include those that do not involve protons, such as those in complex chemistry.

### 10. Why is the Lewis theory considered more general than the Brønsted-Lowry theory?
The Lewis theory is more general because it accounts for acid-base reactions that involve electron pair transfer rather than proton transfer.

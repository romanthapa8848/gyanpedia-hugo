# Brønsted–Lowry Definition of Acids and Bases
The Brønsted–Lowry theory, proposed by Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry in 1923, defines acids and bases in terms of proton ($H^+$) transfer rather than the focus on $H^+$ and $OH^-$ ions as in the Arrhenius theory. According to this theory:
- **Acids** are proton donors. An acid donates a hydrogen ion ($H^+$) to another species.
- **Bases** are proton acceptors. A base accepts a hydrogen ion ($H^+$) from another species.

This theory expands the concept of acids and bases to reactions in non-aqueous solvents and those involving species that don’t fit the traditional definition.

For example, in the reaction between $HCl$ and ammonia ($NH_3$):
$$
\text{HCl} + \text{NH}_3 \rightarrow \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{Cl}^-
$$
- **HCl** is the acid because it donates a proton ($H^+$).
- **NH₃** is the base because it accepts the proton ($H^+$).

## Summary
The Brønsted–Lowry definition of acids and bases is more versatile than the Arrhenius theory, as it is based on proton transfer, rather than the creation of $H^+$ or $OH^-$ ions. This definition applies to a broader range of reactions, including those in non-aqueous solvents and involving substances that don't release $H^+$ or $OH^-$ ions.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the Brønsted–Lowry definition of an acid?
A Brønsted–Lowry acid is a substance that donates a proton ($H^+$) to another substance.

### 2. What is the Brønsted–Lowry definition of a base?
A Brønsted–Lowry base is a substance that accepts a proton ($H^+$) from another substance.

### 3. How is the Brønsted–Lowry theory different from the Arrhenius theory?
The Brønsted–Lowry theory focuses on proton transfer, while the Arrhenius theory is limited to aqueous solutions and involves $H^+$ and $OH^-$ ions.

### 4. Can the Brønsted–Lowry theory explain acid-base reactions in non-aqueous solvents?
Yes, the Brønsted–Lowry theory can explain acid-base reactions in both aqueous and non-aqueous solvents.

### 5. What happens in a Brønsted–Lowry acid-base reaction?
In a Brønsted–Lowry acid-base reaction, the acid donates a proton ($H^+$), and the base accepts it.

### 6. Does the Brønsted–Lowry theory apply to reactions that do not involve $H^+$ or $OH^-$ ions?
Yes, the Brønsted–Lowry theory applies to reactions where the transfer of protons occurs, even if $H^+$ or $OH^-$ ions are not involved directly.

### 7. Can water act as both an acid and a base in the Brønsted–Lowry theory?
Yes, water can act as both an acid and a base, depending on the reaction. For example, it can donate a proton (acting as an acid) or accept a proton (acting as a base).

### 8. How does the Brønsted–Lowry theory apply to ammonia?
Ammonia acts as a base in the Brønsted–Lowry theory because it can accept a proton ($H^+$) from an acid like $HCl$.

### 9. What is the role of $H^+$ ions in the Brønsted–Lowry theory?
$H^+$ ions are central to the Brønsted–Lowry theory, as acids donate them and bases accept them during the reaction.

### 10. What are conjugate acids and bases in the Brønsted–Lowry theory?
Conjugate acids and bases are pairs of substances that differ by a single proton. For example, in the reaction between $HCl$ and $NH₃$, $NH₄^+$ is the conjugate acid of $NH₃$, and $Cl^-$ is the conjugate base of $HCl$.

# Cell Potential and Standard Cell Potential

Cell potential is a fundamental concept in electrochemistry. It represents the difference in electric potential between two electrodes of an electrochemical cell when a redox reaction occurs.

On the other hand, **Standard Cell Potential** refers to the cell potential under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 atm pressure, and 25°C). The cell potential is measured in volts and helps determine whether a reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous.

## Cell Potential
Cell potential ($E_{\text{cell}}$) is the difference in potential energy between two electrodes in an electrochemical cell when it is operating. It can be either positive or negative, depending on the spontaneity of the reaction.

### Formula for Cell Potential:
The formula to calculate the overall cell potential is:

$$ E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cathode}} - E_{\text{anode}} $$

- $E_{\text{cathode}}$ is the electrode potential of the cathode (where reduction occurs).
- $E_{\text{anode}}$ is the electrode potential of the anode (where oxidation occurs).

When $E_{\text{cell}}$ is positive, the reaction is **spontaneous**; if it’s negative, the reaction is **non-spontaneous**.

## Standard Cell Potential
Standard cell potential ($E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$) is the potential difference between the two electrodes under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 atm pressure, 25°C). It is used to predict the direction of the redox reaction.

### Standard Electrode Potential:
The standard electrode potential of any half-reaction is the potential when it is connected to the **Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)**, which is assigned a potential of 0 V. This reference helps determine the tendency of an electrode to gain or lose electrons.

### Formula for Standard Cell Potential:
The standard cell potential is calculated by:

$$ E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}} $$

Where:
- $E^\circ_{\text{cathode}}$ is the standard electrode potential of the cathode.
- $E^\circ_{\text{anode}}$ is the standard electrode potential of the anode.

A positive $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$ indicates that the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions.

## Summary

- **Cell Potential** is the voltage or potential difference generated by an electrochemical cell when operating. It can be calculated under any condition.
- **Standard Cell Potential** is the cell potential under standard conditions, helping to determine the spontaneity of the reaction.
- The cell potential is calculated by subtracting the potential of the anode from that of the cathode, while standard conditions are required to calculate the standard cell potential.

## FAQs

### 1. What is the difference between cell potential and standard cell potential?
Cell potential is the potential difference between two electrodes during the operation of an electrochemical cell, while standard cell potential is the potential difference under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 atm pressure, and 25°C).

### 2. What is standard electrode potential?
The standard electrode potential is the potential of a half-cell measured against the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), which is assigned a potential of 0 V.

### 3. How is cell potential calculated?
Cell potential is calculated by subtracting the electrode potential of the anode from the electrode potential of the cathode:  
$$ E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cathode}} - E_{\text{anode}} $$

### 4. What does a positive standard cell potential mean?
A positive standard cell potential indicates that the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions.

### 5. What happens at the anode during an electrochemical reaction?
At the anode, oxidation occurs, and electrons are released into the external circuit.

### 6. What happens at the cathode during an electrochemical reaction?
At the cathode, reduction occurs, and electrons are accepted from the external circuit.

### 7. Can a cell potential be negative?
Yes, a negative cell potential indicates a non-spontaneous reaction.

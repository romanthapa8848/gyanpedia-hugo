## Objectives

The main objectives of the survey camp, scheduled during the third year first part, are as follows:

- To give the students an ample opportunity to consolidate and update their practical and theoretical knowledge in engineering surveying, in actual field conditions and with practical problems.
- To provide the students with real field-based exposure to learn and apply different surveying methods, modern surveying instruments, computational practices, and ways of presenting their final reports.

A) **Horizontal Control Practices for Large Area Major Traverse:**

For this purpose, at least 1.5 km periphery area (not less than 15-17 stations) shall be enclosed by forming the closed traverse, and the coordinates of those traverse points shall be controlled with reference to the national grid system. X and Y coordinates shall be controlled by Total Station, and Z coordinates must be controlled by Auto Level.

**Time Allocated:** 2 Days (including reconnaissance, station selection, and pegging of major traverse, minor traverse, major traverse angles, distance measurement, etc.)

B) **Horizontal and Vertical Control for Forming Minor Traverse Inside the Major Traverse:**

For this purpose, a detailed topographic survey shall be conducted within the perimeter of the semi-built-up area around 4.0 to 6.0 hectares of land (about 5-7 control points). Coordinates (XYZ) of these traverses, including details, shall be controlled by using Total Station and Auto Level. Link traverse exercise must be compulsory.

**Time Allocated:** 5 Days

- 1 Day for fly leveling and RL transfer
- 2.5 Days for detailing in minor traverse
- 1.5 Days for computation and plotting of traverse

Vertical control for control points shall be done by fly leveling, and detailing shall be done by using Total Station and Theodolite. Data saving in a data logger (electronic field book) and manual booking both should be practiced in detailing.

C) **Bridge Site Survey:**

A detailed topographic survey of a suitable bridge site area (200m x 120m) shall be conducted, by which Topographic Map, L-section, X-section, etc., shall be prepared at standard scale.

**Time Allocated:** 1.5 Days

Detailing shall be done by using Total Station. Vertical control for control points shall be done by Auto Level.

D) **Road Alignment Survey:**

At least a 600m road alignment survey shall be conducted, from which plans, L-section, X-section, etc., shall be drawn at standard scale, including selection of grades and formation levels.

**Time Allocated:** 1.5 Days

## Requirements:

- As far as possible, the number of students for each group should not be more than six (6).
- For conducting the camp, as far as possible, modern surveying equipment such as Total Station, EDM, Auto Level, etc., are to be used.

---

## Evaluation Criteria:

**For Internal (50 Marks):**

- Regular evaluation throughout the 10 days, as well as viva for computation and plotting of major traverse, minor traverse, viva for road and bridge site survey, and traverse orientation check should be taken.

**For Final (50 Marks):**

- Standard reports shall be prepared group-wise. During compilation of the report, data shall be submitted content-wise, and all the reference sketches and standard drawings shall be compiled in A3 size. All the original data and drawings shall be presented during the final viva.

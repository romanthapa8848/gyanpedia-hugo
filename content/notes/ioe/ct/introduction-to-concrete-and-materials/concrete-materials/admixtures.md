# Admixtures - Classification of Admixtures, Introduction to Commonly Used Admixtures (Super-plasticizer, Waterproofing Agent, and Retarders), Use of Mineral Admixtures in Concrete

## Classification of Admixtures

Admixtures are materials added to concrete to alter its properties either before or during the mixing process. These are generally classified into two main categories:

1. **Chemical Admixtures**:
   - These are substances added to modify specific properties of concrete, such as workability, setting time, and durability.
   - **Examples**: Super-plasticizers, retarders, accelerators, air-entraining agents, waterproofing agents.

2. **Mineral Admixtures**:
   - These are finely ground materials added to concrete, either as a replacement for part of the cement or as an additive.
   - **Examples**: Fly ash, silica fume, slag, rice husk ash, metakaolin.

## Introduction to Commonly Used Admixtures

### 1. **Super-plasticizers**
   - **Function**: Super-plasticizers (also called high-range water reducers) are chemical admixtures that significantly increase the workability of concrete without adding extra water. They reduce the water-to-cement ratio, improving the strength and durability of concrete.
   - **Usage**: They are often used in high-strength concrete mixes and to produce flowing concrete.
   - **Chemical Reaction**: Super-plasticizers disperse the cement particles, reducing the friction between them, allowing a higher slump without increasing water content.

### 2. **Waterproofing Agents**
   - **Function**: Waterproofing agents are added to concrete to reduce water permeability and improve its resistance to water penetration, making the concrete more durable and resistant to moisture.
   - **Usage**: These are particularly important in structures exposed to water, like basements, tanks, and swimming pools.
   - **Types**: Liquid-based (additives mixed into the concrete) and surface-based (applied to hardened concrete).
   - **Chemical Reaction**: Waterproofing agents either reduce the capillary pores or form hydrophobic bonds that prevent water from penetrating the concrete.

### 3. **Retarders**
   - **Function**: Retarders slow down the setting time of concrete, allowing more time for mixing, transportation, and placement. They are especially useful in hot climates or when large volumes of concrete are being placed.
   - **Usage**: In large projects where concrete needs to be transported over long distances or in hot weather to delay premature setting.
   - **Chemical Reaction**: Retarders delay the hydration of cement by interacting with calcium ions, reducing the rate of formation of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), the main compound responsible for setting.

## Use of Mineral Admixtures in Concrete

Mineral admixtures are finely divided materials used in concrete to improve various properties. They can replace a portion of cement or be added as supplementary materials to improve performance.

### 1. **Fly Ash**
   - **Function**: Fly ash is a byproduct from coal-fired power plants and is used to improve the workability, durability, and strength of concrete.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Enhances workability and reduces water demand.
     - Improves long-term strength.
     - Reduces heat of hydration, making it useful in mass concrete applications.
   - **Chemical Reaction**: Reacts with lime to form calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), improving the concrete matrix.

### 2. **Silica Fume**
   - **Function**: Silica fume is a byproduct of producing silicon and ferrosilicon alloys. It improves the strength and durability of concrete, especially in aggressive environments.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Enhances durability, reducing permeability and increasing resistance to sulfate attack and chloride-induced corrosion.
     - Increases compressive strength.
   - **Chemical Reaction**: Reacts with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)â‚‚) to form additional C-S-H, enhancing the density of the concrete.

### 3. **Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS)**
   - **Function**: GGBFS is produced from the byproduct of iron and steel manufacturing. It is used to enhance the long-term strength and durability of concrete.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Reduces heat of hydration.
     - Improves resistance to sulfate attack.
     - Increases resistance to chloride-induced corrosion.
   - **Chemical Reaction**: Reacts with calcium hydroxide to form additional C-S-H and calcium alumino-silicate hydrates (C-A-S-H).

## Summary

Admixtures play an essential role in enhancing the properties of concrete. Chemical admixtures such as super-plasticizers, waterproofing agents, and retarders help improve workability, water resistance, and setting time. Mineral admixtures like fly ash, silica fume, and GGBFS are used to improve the strength, durability, and sustainability of concrete, reducing environmental impact by replacing a portion of cement with waste products. The use of these admixtures ensures better performance and longevity of concrete structures.

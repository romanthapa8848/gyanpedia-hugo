# Shrinkage and Creep

Shrinkage and creep are two important phenomena that occur in hardened concrete, influencing the long-term performance and durability of concrete structures. Shrinkage refers to the reduction in volume of concrete as it dries and hardens, while creep refers to the time-dependent deformation under sustained load. Both of these factors can lead to cracking, dimensional changes, and potential structural damage if not properly considered during the design phase.

## Shrinkage in Concrete

Shrinkage in concrete refers to the reduction in its volume as it dries and cures, due to the loss of moisture. Shrinkage is a gradual process that typically occurs over the first few months after concrete placement, but the effects may continue for years.

### Types of Shrinkage:
1. **Plastic Shrinkage:** This type occurs during the early stages of curing while the concrete is still in a plastic (unhardened) state. It is mainly caused by the evaporation of water from the surface of the concrete.
2. **Drying Shrinkage:** This is the most common type of shrinkage, occurring when the concrete hardens and loses moisture over time due to environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity.
3. **Autogenous Shrinkage:** This shrinkage occurs due to the chemical reaction between cement and water. It happens even when the concrete is not exposed to external drying.
4. **Chemical Shrinkage:** This shrinkage is associated with the chemical reactions that take place during the hydration of cement, leading to a volume reduction.

### Factors Affecting Shrinkage:
- **Water-Cement Ratio:** A higher water-cement ratio results in greater shrinkage because more water is available for evaporation.
- **Cement Type:** Different types of cement have different shrinkage characteristics. Some cements may lead to greater shrinkage.
- **Temperature and Humidity:** High temperature and low humidity accelerate the rate of evaporation, leading to higher shrinkage.
- **Mix Proportions:** The mix design, particularly the ratio of aggregates to cement, can influence the extent of shrinkage.

## Creep in Concrete

Creep is the time-dependent deformation of concrete under a sustained load. Unlike elastic deformation, which is immediate and reversible, creep continues over time as the concrete is subjected to constant stress.

### Causes of Creep:
Creep occurs due to the flow of the material when it is subjected to long-term stress. The behavior is primarily governed by the internal structure of the hardened concrete, and the molecular motion of the hydration products under sustained load leads to gradual deformation.

### Factors Affecting Creep:
- **Concrete Strength:** Concrete with lower compressive strength tends to creep more under the same load.
- **Load Magnitude and Duration:** The greater the load and the longer the duration, the more significant the creep.
- **Age of Concrete:** Concrete that is older (with more hydration) tends to have lower creep than freshly mixed concrete.
- **Moisture Availability:** A moist environment may reduce creep by allowing continued hydration, while a dry environment may exacerbate creep.
- **Temperature:** Higher temperatures can increase the rate of creep by accelerating the internal molecular motion.

### Creep and Stress-Strain Relationship:
Under sustained load, the stress-strain relationship is different from the elastic case. The total strain experienced by concrete under sustained load is the sum of the elastic strain and the creep strain. The creep strain increases with time and can significantly affect the long-term deflection of structural elements like beams and slabs.

### Creep Models:
Several models exist to predict creep behavior, such as the power law model or the time-dependent deformation models based on empirical data. These models help in estimating long-term deflections and deformations in concrete structures.

## Shrinkage and Creep Interaction

Both shrinkage and creep can have a combined effect on concrete structures. Shrinkage often leads to cracking, while creep may cause long-term deformation. When these two phenomena occur simultaneously, they can exacerbate each other's effects, particularly in elements that are restrained (e.g., beams, slabs) or under constant load.

### Effects on Structural Design:
- **Cracking:** Shrinkage can lead to surface cracking, which may then become a pathway for the ingress of water or chemicals, leading to durability issues. Creep, if not accounted for, can cause excessive deflections over time.
- **Serviceability Issues:** Creep can lead to permanent deformations such as sagging of beams or slabs, which could compromise the functionality of the structure.
- **Long-term Strength Reduction:** In severe cases, excessive shrinkage and creep can lead to long-term strength degradation, compromising the safety of the structure.

## Summary

Shrinkage and creep are essential considerations in the behavior of hardened concrete. Shrinkage leads to volume reduction as concrete dries, while creep causes long-term deformation under sustained load. Both phenomena are influenced by factors such as mix design, environmental conditions, and concrete strength. Proper control and understanding of these factors are critical for the durability and performance of concrete structures.

## FAQs

### 1. What is shrinkage in concrete?
Shrinkage refers to the reduction in the volume of concrete as it loses moisture during hardening and curing.

### 2. What causes plastic shrinkage in concrete?
Plastic shrinkage occurs when water evaporates from the surface of the concrete before it has set, leading to surface cracking.

### 3. How does the water-cement ratio affect shrinkage?
A higher water-cement ratio increases the shrinkage because more water is available to evaporate during the drying process.

### 4. What is the difference between drying shrinkage and autogenous shrinkage?
Drying shrinkage occurs due to moisture loss, while autogenous shrinkage occurs due to the chemical reactions in the hydration process, even without external moisture loss.

### 5. What is creep in concrete?
Creep is the time-dependent deformation of concrete under sustained load, which increases over time as the concrete continues to deform.

### 6. How does creep affect concrete structures?
Creep can lead to long-term deflections and deformations, such as sagging in beams or slabs, affecting the structural integrity and serviceability of concrete elements.

### 7. What factors influence creep in concrete?
Factors such as the concrete strength, load magnitude, duration, and temperature all influence the rate of creep in concrete.

### 8. How does temperature affect shrinkage and creep?
High temperatures can accelerate both shrinkage and creep by increasing the rate of hydration and evaporation, leading to faster deformation.

### 9. Can shrinkage and creep be minimized?
Both shrinkage and creep can be minimized by proper mix design, using low water-cement ratios, adding supplementary materials like fly ash, and controlling environmental conditions during curing.

### 10. What are the effects of shrinkage and creep on concrete structures?
Both shrinkage and creep can lead to cracking, long-term deformation, and serviceability issues if not properly managed during design and construction.

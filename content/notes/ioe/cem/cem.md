## Calculus in Engineering

Here are 10 common calculus formulas used in engineering applications:

1. **Derivative of a Function**:  
   $ \frac{d}{dx} [f(x)] = f'(x) $

2. **Integral of a Function**:  
   $ \int f(x) dx = F(x) + C $

3. **Power Rule**:  
   $ \frac{d}{dx} [x^n] = nx^{n-1} $

4. **Chain Rule**:  
   $ \frac{d}{dx} [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) $

5. **Product Rule**:  
   $ \frac{d}{dx} [f(x) \cdot g(x)] = f'(x) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x) $

6. **Quotient Rule**:  
   $ \frac{d}{dx} \left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right] = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2} $

7. **Second Derivative**:  
   $ \frac{d^2}{dx^2} [f(x)] = f''(x) $

8. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**:  
   $ \int_a^b f'(x) dx = f(b) - f(a) $

9. **Integration by Parts**:  
   $ \int u dv = uv - \int v du $

10. **Taylor Series Expansion**:  
    $ f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \cdots $

## PHP Program Example

Hereâ€™s a simple PHP program that outputs "Hello, World!":

```php
<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

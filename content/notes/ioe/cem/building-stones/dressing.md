## 1. Definition and Purpose of Stone Dressing

### a. Definition

Dressing of stone involves the mechanical or manual processes used to prepare stones by trimming, shaping, and finishing them to achieve desired dimensions and surface characteristics.

### b. Purpose

- **Aesthetics:** Enhances the visual appeal of stones for use in facades, monuments, and other decorative applications.
- **Fit and Alignment:** Ensures that stones fit together precisely in masonry work, contributing to the stability and durability of structures.
- **Surface Finish:** Provides a smooth surface that can resist weathering and improve bonding with mortar.

## 2. Methods of Dressing Stone

### a. Hand Dressing

- **Chiseling:** Involves using chisels and hammers to shape and refine the stone manually. This technique is common for achieving intricate designs.
- **Pointing:** A method where pointed tools are used to roughen or smooth surfaces, depending on the desired finish.

### b. Machine Dressing

- **Sawing:** Uses power saws equipped with diamond blades to cut stones into precise dimensions, allowing for more uniform results.
- **Grinding:** Involves the use of grinding machines to achieve a polished finish on stone surfaces, enhancing their aesthetic quality.

### c. Finishing Techniques

- **Honing:** Creates a smooth, matte finish by using finer abrasives on the stone surface.
- **Polishing:** Utilizes fine abrasives to produce a high-gloss finish, often applied to marble and granite surfaces.

## 2. Types of Clay Products

### a. Bricks

- **Description:** Bricks are rectangular blocks made from clay, used primarily in construction for walls and pavements.
- **Types:** Common types include fired bricks, which are hardened in a kiln, and unfired bricks, which are air-dried.

### b. Tiles

- **Description:** Clay tiles are flat pieces made from clay and are often used for roofing, flooring, and wall coverings.
- **Types:** Includes ceramic tiles, terracotta tiles, and porcelain tiles, each with different properties and uses.

### c. Pottery

- **Description:** Pottery refers to a variety of clay products created for functional and decorative purposes, including dishes, vases, and art pieces.
- **Types:** Earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain are the primary categories of pottery, differentiated by firing temperature and composition.

### d. Ceramics

- **Description:** Ceramics encompass a broad range of clay products, including bricks and tiles, but also extend to fine art and tableware.
- **Types:** Advanced ceramics, like those used in electronics and dental applications, are produced through specific processes and materials.

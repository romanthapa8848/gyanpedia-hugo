## 1. Types of Tiles

Tiles can be classified based on several factors, including material, size, application, and finish. Here are the most common types:

### a. Ceramic Tiles

- **Description:** Made from clay and other natural materials, ceramic tiles are fired at high temperatures to create a hard, durable surface. They are available in various colors and patterns.
- **Types:**
  - **Glazed Ceramic Tiles:** Have a glass-like coating that makes them water-resistant and easy to clean. Ideal for moisture-prone areas.
  - **Unglazed Ceramic Tiles:** More porous and suitable for areas with high foot traffic, offering better slip resistance.
- **Applications:** Commonly used for flooring, walls, and backsplashes in both residential and commercial settings.

### b. Porcelain Tiles

- **Description:** A subtype of ceramic tiles, porcelain tiles are denser and less porous, making them more durable and suitable for high-moisture areas. They often replicate the appearance of natural stone or wood.
- **Characteristics:** Resistant to stains, scratches, and moisture, making them an excellent choice for high-traffic areas.
- **Applications:** Ideal for bathrooms, kitchens, and outdoor spaces where durability is crucial.

### c. Natural Stone Tiles

- **Description:** Sourced from natural stone materials such as granite, marble, limestone, and slate, these tiles offer a unique and elegant look, with each tile having distinct natural variations.
- **Types:**
  - **Granite Tiles:** Known for their hardness and resistance to scratches and heat.
  - **Marble Tiles:** Renowned for their beauty and variety, though they require more maintenance due to their porous nature.
  - **Slate Tiles:** Durable and slip-resistant, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications.
- **Applications:** Frequently used in luxury settings, kitchens, bathrooms, and outdoor patios.

### d. Glass Tiles

- **Description:** Made from glass, these tiles provide a reflective surface that enhances brightness and depth in a space. They can be translucent or opaque.
- **Characteristics:** Available in various colors, shapes, and sizes, glass tiles can be used as accents or in larger applications.
- **Applications:** Commonly used in backsplashes, shower walls, and decorative applications to create visual interest.

### e. Vinyl Tiles

- **Description:** Made from synthetic materials, vinyl tiles are cost-effective and easy to install. They come in various styles and can mimic other materials like wood and stone.
- **Types:**
  - **Luxury Vinyl Tiles (LVT):** Offer a more realistic look and feel, making them ideal for residential and commercial settings.
  - **Vinyl Composite Tiles (VCT):** Durable and suitable for high-traffic areas, commonly used in commercial spaces such as schools and hospitals.
- **Applications:** Suitable for both residential and commercial flooring due to their durability and versatility.

### f. Mosaic Tiles

- **Description:** Small tiles typically measuring 2 inches or less, often made from ceramic, glass, or stone. They allow for creative expression through intricate patterns.
- **Characteristics:** Can be arranged in various designs, from simple patterns to complex artworks, enhancing visual appeal.
- **Applications:** Commonly used in bathrooms, kitchens, and as decorative accents or borders.

### g. Terracotta Tiles

- **Description:** Made from red clay, terracotta tiles have a rustic appearance and natural feel. They are porous and require sealing to prevent staining.

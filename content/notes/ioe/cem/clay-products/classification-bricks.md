# Classification of Bricks

Bricks are one of the most widely used building materials, and their classification is based on various criteria, including manufacturing processes, materials used, and specific applications. Understanding the different types of bricks is essential for selecting the right type for construction projects.

---

## 1. Based on Manufacturing Process

### a. Burnt Bricks

- **Definition:** Made by firing clay or other raw materials at high temperatures.
- **Characteristics:** Highly durable, water-resistant, and suitable for load-bearing applications.
- **Examples:** Common burnt clay bricks.

### b. Non-Burnt Bricks

- **Definition:** Made from raw materials that are not fired but rather cured or dried.
- **Characteristics:** Generally lighter but less durable than burnt bricks.
- **Examples:** Mud bricks, concrete bricks.

## 2. Based on Composition

### a. Clay Bricks

- **Definition:** Made primarily from clay and water.
- **Characteristics:** Available in various colors and shapes; good thermal and sound insulation properties.

### b. Fly Ash Bricks

- **Definition:** Made from fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion, mixed with water, lime, and gypsum.
- **Characteristics:** Lightweight, eco-friendly, and have high compressive strength.

### c. Concrete Bricks

- **Definition:** Made from a mixture of cement, aggregates, and water.
- **Characteristics:** Strong and durable; used for load-bearing walls and structural applications.

## 3. Based on Structure

### a. Solid Bricks

- **Definition:** Fully solid with no holes or voids.
- **Characteristics:** High compressive strength and stability; used for load-bearing walls.

### b. Hollow Bricks

- **Definition:** Contain one or more cavities or holes.
- **Characteristics:** Lighter than solid bricks, provide better thermal insulation, and are often used in non-load-bearing walls.

## 4. Based on Size

### a. Standard Size Bricks

- **Definition:** Bricks that conform to traditional sizes, typically 190mm x 90mm x 90mm.
- **Characteristics:** Easily handled and laid, ensuring uniformity in construction.

### b. Modular Bricks

- **Definition:** Bricks designed with specific dimensions to fit modular construction systems.
- **Characteristics:** Allow for faster and more efficient construction processes.

## 5. Special Purpose Bricks

### a. Reinforced Bricks

- **Definition:** Contain reinforcement materials such as steel rods or mesh.
- **Characteristics:** Provide enhanced strength and durability, suitable for structures subject to heavy loads.

### b. Acid-Resistant Bricks

- **Definition:** Made with special materials to withstand acidic environments.
- **Characteristics:** Used in chemical industries and wastewater treatment plants.

### c. Fire Bricks

- **Definition:** Made to withstand high temperatures without deforming.
- **Characteristics:** Commonly used in kilns, fireplaces, and furnaces.

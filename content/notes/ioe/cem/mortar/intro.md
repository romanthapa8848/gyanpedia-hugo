# Mortar: Introduction

Mortar is a vital construction material used primarily as a binding agent for masonry units, such as bricks and stones. It serves various functions, including adhesion, filling gaps, and providing structural integrity to buildings and other structures. Understanding the properties, types, and applications of mortar is essential for architects, engineers, and builders to ensure optimal performance in construction projects.

## 2. Types of Mortar

### a. Cement Mortar

- **Description:** A mixture of cement, sand, and water, providing high strength and durability.
- **Applications:** Used in load-bearing walls, structural elements, and areas exposed to moisture.

### b. Lime Mortar

- **Description:** Made from lime, sand, and water, it is more flexible and breathable than cement mortar.
- **Applications:** Commonly used in historical restoration projects and for masonry where breathability is essential.

### c. Masonry Mortar

- **Description:** Specifically designed for use in masonry construction, combining cement, lime, and sand in specific proportions.
- **Applications:** Used for laying bricks, blocks, and stone in various types of masonry.

### d. Modified Mortar

- **Description:** Mortar with added polymers or other materials to enhance properties such as adhesion, flexibility, and water resistance.
- **Applications:** Ideal for applications requiring improved performance, such as tile setting and exterior masonry.

# Classification of Mortar

Mortar is classified based on several criteria, including composition, properties, and applications. Understanding these classifications helps in selecting the appropriate mortar type for specific construction needs.

---

## 1. Classification Based on Composition

### a. Cement Mortar

- **Description:** A mixture of cement, sand, and water, providing high strength and durability.
- **Applications:** Suitable for load-bearing walls, structural elements, and areas exposed to moisture.

### b. Lime Mortar

- **Description:** Composed of lime, sand, and water, it is more flexible and allows for moisture permeability.
- **Applications:** Commonly used in historical restoration projects and in situations where breathability is essential.

### c. Masonry Mortar

- **Description:** A specific blend of cement, lime, and sand formulated for masonry work.
- **Applications:** Used for laying bricks, blocks, and stones in various masonry constructions.

### d. Modified Mortar

- **Description:** Mortar with added polymers or other additives to enhance properties like adhesion and water resistance.
- **Applications:** Ideal for demanding applications, such as tile setting and exterior masonry.

---

## 2. Classification Based on Properties

### a. Workable Mortar

- **Description:** Mortar that can be easily mixed, applied, and shaped during construction.
- **Significance:** Ensures ease of application and consistency during construction activities.

### b. Durable Mortar

- **Description:** Mortar designed to withstand environmental factors, including moisture, freeze-thaw cycles, and chemical attacks.
- **Significance:** Essential for long-lasting construction, especially in harsh climates.

### c. Flexible Mortar

- **Description:** Mortar that can accommodate slight movements in masonry without cracking.
- **Significance:** Important for structures subject to vibrations, settling, or thermal expansion.

---

## 3. Classification Based on Applications

### a. Structural Mortar

- **Description:** Mortar used in load-bearing applications, providing strength and stability to structures.
- **Applications:** Used in foundations, walls, and other structural elements.

### b. Non-structural Mortar

- **Description:** Mortar primarily used for aesthetic purposes or as a filler.
- **Applications:** Used in decorative masonry, plastering, and other non-load-bearing applications.

### c. Specialty Mortar

- **Description:** Mortar formulated for specific applications, such as fire-resistant or waterproof mortar.
- **Applications:** Used in specialized construction scenarios requiring unique properties.

The primary types of mortar include cement mortar, lime mortar, masonry mortar, and modified mortar.

### 2. How is cement mortar different from lime mortar?

Cement mortar is stronger and more durable, while lime mortar is more flexible and breathable.

### 3. What is the significance of modified mortar?

Modified mortar contains additives that improve its adhesion, flexibility, and water resistance, making it suitable for demanding applications.

### 4. What properties are important in durable mortar?

Durable mortar should resist moisture, freeze-thaw cycles, and chemical attacks to ensure long-lasting performance.

### 5. What are structural and non-structural mortars?

Structural mortars provide strength for load-bearing applications, while non-structural mortars are used for aesthetic purposes or as fillers.

### 6. What is specialty mortar?

Specialty mortar is designed for specific applications, such as fire-resistant or waterproof mortar.

### 7. How does workability affect mortar?

Workability ensures that mortar can be easily mixed and applied, affecting the efficiency and quality of construction.

### 8. Can lime mortar be used in modern construction?

Yes, lime mortar is used in modern construction, particularly in restoration projects and situations requiring flexibility.

### 9. What are the benefits of using flexible mortar?

Flexible mortar can accommodate slight movements in masonry, reducing the risk of cracking in structures subject to vibrations or thermal expansion.

### 10. How can I choose the right type of mortar for my project?

Selecting the right mortar depends on factors like the type of masonry, environmental conditions, and specific performance requirements.

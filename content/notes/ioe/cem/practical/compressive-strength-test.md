## 2. Objectives

- To determine the compressive strength of brick samples.
- To determine the compressive strength of stone samples.
- To compare the compressive strength of different materials for construction applications.

## 3. Equipment and Materials

- **Equipment:**

  - Universal Testing Machine (UTM) or Compression Testing Machine
  - Vernier caliper or measuring tape
  - Weighing balance
  - Steel loading plates (if required)
  - Water for curing (for brick samples)

- **Materials:**

## 4. Sample Preparation

### 4.1. Brick Sample Preparation

1. Select brick samples with uniform dimensions.
2. Measure the dimensions (length, width, height) using a Vernier caliper or measuring tape.
3. Weigh each brick sample (W).

### 4.2. Stone Sample Preparation

## 5. Testing Procedure

### 5.1. Compressive Strength Test for Brick Samples

1. **Placement in Testing Machine:**

   - Place the brick sample centrally between the loading plates of the UTM.
   - Ensure the surface of the brick is flat and even.

2. **Application of Load:**

   - Start the testing machine and apply load gradually at a uniform rate (typically 14 N/mm²/min).
   - Monitor the load until the brick fails.

3. **Recording Results:**

   - Record the maximum load (P) applied at failure.
   - Calculate the compressive strength using the formula:

   $$
   \text{Compressive Strength (f)} = \frac{P}{A}
   $$

   where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the brick.

### 5.2. Compressive Strength Test for Stone Samples

1. **Placement in Testing Machine:**

   - Place the stone sample centrally between the loading plates of the UTM.
   - Ensure the surface of the stone is flat and even.

2. **Application of Load:**

   - Start the testing machine and apply load gradually at a uniform rate (typically 14 N/mm²/min).
   - Monitor the load until the stone fails.

3. **Recording Results:**

   - Record the maximum load (P) applied at failure.
   - Calculate the compressive strength using the same formula as for bricks:

   $$
   \text{Compressive Strength (f)} = \frac{P}{A}
   $$

   where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the stone.

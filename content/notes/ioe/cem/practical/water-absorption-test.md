# Water Absorption Test and Bulk Specific Gravity Test on Brick Sample

The Water Absorption Test and Bulk Specific Gravity Test are essential procedures for assessing the physical properties of brick samples. These tests help determine the durability and suitability of bricks for construction purposes.

## 4. Water Absorption Test Procedure

### 4.1. Sample Preparation

1. Select at least three representative brick samples.
2. Measure and record the dry weight of each brick sample ($W_1$).

### 4.2. Immersion in Water

1. Submerge the brick samples in water for 24 hours.
2. Ensure that the samples are fully immersed.

### 4.3. Post-Immersion Measurement

1. Remove the bricks from water and allow excess surface water to drain.
2. Measure and record the weight of each saturated brick sample ($W_2$).

### 4.4. Calculation

Calculate the water absorption using the formula:

$$
\text{Water Absorption (\%)}  = \frac{(W_2 - W_1)}{W_1} \times 100
$$

## 5. Bulk Specific Gravity Test Procedure

### 5.1. Sample Preparation

1. Select the same brick samples used for the water absorption test.
2. Measure and record the dry weight of each brick sample ($W_1$).

### 5.2. Volume Measurement

1. Submerge each brick sample in a graduated cylinder filled with a known volume of water.
2. Measure the new water level ($V_2$) after immersing the brick sample.
3. Calculate the volume of the brick using the formula:

$$
\text{Volume of Brick} = V_2 - V_1
$$

where $V_1$ is the initial water level.

### 5.3. Calculation of Bulk Specific Gravity

Calculate the bulk specific gravity using the formula:

$$
\text{Bulk Specific Gravity} = \frac{W_1}{\text{Volume of Brick}}
$$

## 6. Results and Discussion

### 6.1. Water Absorption Results

The water absorption for each sample is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Water Absorption (\%)} = \left( \frac{W_2 - W_1}{W_1} \right) \times 100
$$

| Sample No. | Dry Weight ($W_1$) (g) | Saturated Weight ($W_2$) (g) | Water Absorption (\%) |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1          | 200                    | 240                          | 20                    |
| 2          | 210                    | 252                          | 20                    |
| 3          | 190                    | 228                          | 20                    |

#### Water Absorption Calculations

- **Sample 1**:
  $$
  \text{Water Absorption} = \left( \frac{240 - 200}{200} \right) \times 100 = 20%
  $$
- **Sample 2**:
  $$
  \text{Water Absorption} = \left( \frac{252 - 210}{210} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
  $$
- **Sample 3**:
  $$
  \text{Water Absorption} = \left( \frac{228 - 190}{190} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
  $$

### 6.2. Bulk Specific Gravity Results

The bulk specific gravity is determined using the formula:

$$
\text{Bulk Specific Gravity} = \frac{W_1}{\text{Volume of Brick (cm}^{3}\text{)}}
$$

| Sample No. | Dry Weight ($W_1$) (g) | Volume of Brick ($\text{cm}^{3}$) | Bulk Specific Gravity $\text{g/cm}^3$ |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1          | 200                    | 180                               | 1.11                                  |
| 2          | 210                    | 190                               | 1.11                                  |
| 3          | 190                    | 170                               | 1.12                                  |

#### Bulk Specific Gravity Calculations

- **Sample 1**:
  $$
  \text{Bulk Specific Gravity} = \frac{200}{180} \approx 1.11
  $$
- **Sample 2**:
  $$
  \text{Bulk Specific Gravity} = \frac{210}{190} \approx 1.11
  $$
- **Sample 3**:
  $$
  \text{Bulk Specific Gravity} = \frac{190}{170} \approx 1.12

# Composition and Properties of Steel

Steel is an alloy primarily composed of iron and carbon, with other elements added to enhance its properties. Its strength, ductility, and versatility make it one of the most important materials used in construction, manufacturing, and various industries. Understanding the composition and properties of steel is crucial for selecting the appropriate type for specific applications.

## 1. Composition of Steel

### a. Basic Components

- **Iron (Fe):** The primary constituent, making up approximately 90-99% of steel.
- **Carbon (C):** Typically comprises 0.02% to 2.1% of steel, which significantly affects its properties. Higher carbon content increases hardness but reduces ductility.

### b. Alloying Elements

Various alloying elements can be added to steel to improve its properties:

- **Manganese (Mn):** Enhances strength, toughness, and hardenability. It also helps remove sulfur impurities.
- **Chromium (Cr):** Increases hardness and corrosion resistance; essential in stainless steel production.
- **Nickel (Ni):** Improves toughness and impact strength; commonly used in high-strength steels.
- **Molybdenum (Mo):** Increases strength and resistance to high temperatures; often used in alloy steels.
- **Vanadium (V):** Improves strength and toughness while refining the grain structure.
- **Silicon (Si):** Enhances strength and helps deoxidize molten steel.
